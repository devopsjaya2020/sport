&lt;p&gt;When he was 26, Qi Min forced his way out by faking a knee injury. It was only then he began to enjoy running, competing in established trail races in China. Soon, he&acirc;Äôd attracted commercial sponsors like Garmin, whose blue pullover he wore the entire weekend at Gaoligong. Now, at age 29, commercial running has transformed his life, as well as the lives of some of China&acirc;Äôs other top runners-though not without risks. Leaving the state system means forfeiting an &acirc;Äúiron rice bowl&acirc;Äù of subsidized housing, wages, and medical care guaranteed by the government-an increasingly rare set of state welfare benefits in China still made available to select government employees, including athletes during their careers. Still, the last year had been good to Qi Min. A few weeks before Gaoligong, he and his girlfriend, Yao Miao, also an elite ultrarunner, turned heads by winning the Vibram Hong Kong 100&acirc;Äôs men&acirc;Äôs and women&acirc;Äôs divisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the race, Qi Min remarked that he hoped one day to join the ranks of the world&acirc;Äôs greatest trail runners, challenging some of the best American and European pros. Not everyone responded to Qi Min and Yao Miao&acirc;Äôs wins with grace, however. Toropov told me that Qi Min&acirc;Äôs comment brought about some pooh-poohing from western runners, a holier-than-thou attitude the Brit resented. In many sports, there&acirc;Äôs a tendency for western audiences to view Chinese athletes as faceless, robot-like figures without personalities, with the exception of big name stars like pro basketball player Yao Ming or retired tennis star Li Na. In the more extreme displays of condescension, Chinese athletes are criticized for fudging their age, or taking performance-enhancing drugs. After Yao Miao and Qi Min&acirc;Äôs wins at the Hong Kong 100, message board comments cast doubt on the results. &acirc;ÄúWas there any PED testing? &acirc;Äù one asked. &acirc;ÄúThis is a very relevant question, especially applicable to any athlete that was part of a government system,&acirc;Äù another commenter named Very Concerned responded.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[What Are The Best Baseball Magazines To Subscribe To?]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;What once was known as America's national pastime is quickly becoming one of the most popular sports around the world. The game of baseball has grown in popularity almost globally with professional leagues in many countries including Mexico, Japan, South Korea, Canada, and all throughout the Caribbean. With such a diverse following amongst its fans the growth of baseball magazines and its related industries has grown tremendously over the past decades. There is virtually every element of information regarding the game available to those who actively seek it out. Baseball magazines have become more and more specialized over the course of the last twenty years as the growing number of recorded statistics kept by major league baseball has increased. As opposed to some magazines of years gone by that would cover all the major sporting events, there is now a trend to highlight and isolate individual sports in order to give fans more specific knowledge about the one sport they love most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;				&lt;i class='icon-eye'&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span&gt;2 679 951&lt;/span&gt;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background:rgba(0,0,0,0.1);padding:0px 10px 1px 10px;border-radius:5px;border:1px solid #000;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.trendhunter.com/slideshow/2019-sports-trends&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Top 100 Sports Trends in 2019 - Trend Hunter&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;cite&gt;www.trendhunter.com&lt;span class=&quot;eipWBe&quot;&gt; &acirc;Ä&ordm; 2019...&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;color:rgba(0,0,0,0.6);&quot;&gt;2019 &lt;em&gt;sports trends&lt;/em&gt; - The expansive list of 2019 &lt;em&gt;sports trends&lt;/em&gt; highlight a plethora of ways of athleticism, creating products, services, and experiences that make ...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also the internet to consider. Many baseball magazines are now published and available online either in a downloadable format or on websites dedicated strictly to what is considered the news of the day. This may include such information as daily player transactions, the latest scores and standings, or even game odds giving the fan the best idea of who will win that day's games. As far as the history of baseball is concerned, some of the most notable and long lasting publications are still around years after their initial publications. The Sporting News, Baseball Digest, and Street and Smith's Baseball Annual are still among the top sellers even today. As such, the early issues of these baseball magazines are currently some of the most sought after items by collectors worldwide. Among the most treasured are those featuring stories and interviews from past superstars of the game. Original magazines from the 1950's featuring the likes of Ted Williams, Mickey Mantle, and Willie Mays attract top dollar by baseball enthusiasts everywhere. The most important aspect of today's baseball magazines is the variety that can be had. If you are a casual fan looking for reviews of last season or previews of the next there is plenty of material available. If it is the breakdown of individual player stats that gets your attention the market is full of publications for you as well. When looking for information any baseball fan can always find what they need at a reasonable price given the options that are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our survey showed that 66 percent of gamers watch reality TV or competition shows, compared to 45 percent of people who don&acirc;Äôt play video games. Consider, too, that many TV companies are facing rising cost pressures and declining revenue. Unscripted TV, such as reality TV, is significantly cheaper than scripted TV and can provide a more affordable way to generate content and revenue as more and more scripted TV and film content moves online. A 30-minute reality TV show episode can cost between US$100,000 and US$500,000 compared to US$3 million for a network TV sitcom episode.19 Due to challenging operating conditions across traditional TV markets, companies may be looking to add lower-cost content compared to scripted content, which could include game-related content. Overall, consumers can access esports and daily streaming through multiple venues, platforms, and devices-in far more ways than they can get to traditional video content. Given the age and broad demographic of gaming consumers, traditional media companies that enter the esports and gaming market may have a rare opportunity to access and monetize these consumers in many ways: from directly owning gaming franchises to digital advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the broad increase in gaming, how do you address the growing nontraditional gaming audience? Would a direct-to-consumer strategy align with Riot&acirc;Äôs plan for growth? Every day, the generation who grew up with gaming as a ubiquitous form of entertainment rises, and that means the addressable market for video games across publishing and esports will grow similarly. On the esports side, we know what delights our core audience, but we are still nascent in our understanding of what content reaches an audience beyond that core. There&acirc;Äôs a tremendous number of gamers who vary wildly in their genre choices, platform choices, and in their other hobbies, but the same can be said for fans of football or soccer. There&acirc;Äôs no single stereotype of a traditional sports fan, and that&acirc;Äôs because sports leagues have found ways to reach out to different groups by offering different value propositions. We&acirc;Äôve already seen the cross-section of gaming with music with K/DA, the Ninja/Drake streaming sessions, as well as gaming and sports with JuJu Smith-Schuster and FaZe Clan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&acirc;Äôs only a matter of time before we see games and esports partnering with other cultural tenets to create more compelling products for the fans. What do you think about adapting franchises for mobile to leverage growth in mobile gaming? And, more broadly, expanding to cross-platform? Expanding video game franchises across platforms is certainly a great way to introduce a new audience to the game and build (or rebuild) momentum around a title that may have plateaued on certain platforms. I don&acirc;Äôt think it has the clearest application for esports, however, as most games have one platform of choice for high-level play. Expanding beyond that doesn&acirc;Äôt do much to bring in new pros, given the switching cost they would have to undergo to adopt the default competitive platform. Games that launch across multiple platforms definitely see impact in terms of building a critical mass of players and capturing the gamer zeitgeist, but I think that&acirc;Äôs more about the impact of mobile gaming in the wider ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Bollywood Shaping Up Fashion Trends- Here's How - Fashion]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The youth of the country are following movie industry trends blindly and they are certainly not to blame. With popular mainstream movies showcasing exciting creations by established and emerging fashion designers, it becomes hard to not follow these apparel trends as seen in movies and brand endorsements. One key factor that makes Bollywood dresses so famous with the common public is that they are easy to wear and effortlessly mould into everyone's routine and lifestyle. Fashion rules set by today's Bollywood industry is guiding the youth to keep a track of what is in fashion and what is trending. Be it a wedding, a festive occasion or any kind of a celebratory event, Bollywood is making its presence felt in a big way. Today, it is no longer a novelty to see a fashion-conscious girl sporting a rich-looking designer gown or a lehenga. With exclusive designs, intricate embroideries and thoughtful weaving, Bollywood replica outfits are quite a rage on all occasions. The uniqueness about Bollywood outfits is that we every film released, a new fashion standard or a trend is created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ohehQrH3fkI?playsinline=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;modestbranding=1' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen title='5 Most INSANE'&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, India's fashion designers find a thriving platform to showcase their talent and also to make their talent more accessible to the general public. For instance, a few movies brought back the virtually dead style of Anarkali dresses and within no time, they became quite a trend. Probably, the first Anarakali dress was sported in the Bollywood legend Mughal-e-Azam, when the beauty icon Madhubala was seen wearing the dress. However, the trend died soon as people that time were not too liberal and experimental with their dressing. The scenario is a completely different one today. Though the trend was started by Madhubala, it was brought back with a huge appeal by contemporary actresses like Kareena Kapoor and Katrina Kaif. Heavy work like gotta, zari and resham augments the appeal and the character of the garment and takes it to a different level altogether. Additionally, Indian girls also like to imitate the jewelry worn by today's actresses along with their dainty attires. The trend of copying Bollywood dresses is so much in vogue that a popular theme in different parties is Bollywood. Be it the quintessential saree or the tried and tested Anarkali dress, Indian women are no more shy to sport those figure-hugging garments while still being rooted in their traditional garb. The world has surely taken notice and one can see Bollywood outfits traveling places on the world map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running was becoming a ubiquitous middle-class hobby, and a more individual notion of sport was taking hold in the lives of both elite runners and hobbyists, leaving the older paradigms of sport-its more nationalist ethos and the dominance of state institutions-behind. One of China&acirc;Äôs best runners, Garmin-sponsored Qi Min, recently left that old baggage behind. He&acirc;Äôd grown up in a poor region of rural Yunnan, at more than 5,500 feet in elevation, about a 10-hour drive from urban Tengchong. When he was 11, he dominated a middle school track meet, and coaches from the local county&acirc;Äôs sports academy came calling. The next year, his family enrolled him at the government-run county academy, the lowest rung in the Soviet-inspired system. He attended school in the mornings and trained in the afternoons-a significantly reduced workload compared to regular schools. While he missed his family terribly, Qi Min showed promise as a runner. By 14, he&acirc;Äôd ascended to the provincial team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Athletes spent their entire time training there, three hours in the morning and three after lunch, and no longer took classes. Nobody was allowed off campus, and nontraining hours were used for recovery, until lights out at 9 p.m. At competitions, he was exposed only to hotels and competition zones. A shuttle bus drove them between. &acirc;ÄúWe&acirc;Äôre completely cut off from the outside world,&acirc;Äù Qi Min told me, speaking in Chinese and laughing dryly. &acirc;ÄúIt&acirc;Äôs kind of like criminals living in jail, where you have no idea what&acirc;Äôs going on outside, except for what you can see on your electronic devices. I never liked it, but you can&acirc;Äôt leave, since you&acirc;Äôve got no way to survive outside the school. Qi Min compared the academy to military training, and echoed a common criticism of China&acirc;Äôs sports system-the incredible cost of sacrificing an education for athletics. He referenced Olympics hopefuls who, with little to no education, had gone broke after their athletic careers ended.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[International Appeal Of Designer Sarees - Clothing]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Gone are the days when Indian clothes like sarees were seen only at special occasions or only in the most conservative and traditional styles. In the last decade, they have come into their own as a timeless and elegant women's outfit, unique in terms of structure and style and perfectly suited for a modern woman's wardrobe. Internationally renowned Indian designers have done a lot to popularize them world-wide, showcasing the different varieties with updated contemporary alterations in their collections. The stately, graceful and sensuous drape of the sari has a universal appeal, while the ethnic embroideries and embellishments these high-end sarees usually sport are coveted for their unusual and vibrant beauty. Moreover the contemporary styles including the pre-stitched type, lehenga type or gown type look just as elegant but are much easier to wear. Designer blouses, too, come with bolder cuts and modern silhouettes which western women prefer. However saris don't just appeal to international celebrities; in fact they are slowly but surely making their presence felt even amongst the general public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major reason for this is that one can now purchase many varieties of designer sarees online which makes obtaining them abroad very easy as compared to earlier, when one would have to hunt for an outlet of the desired fashion designer and/or be satisfied with extremely limited choices at department stores. This garment may now have an international reach but it remains essentially ethnic; when buying designer sarees online, India remains the primary source. Whether it is because of the authentic, regional work they are often etched with or the use of exclusive handcrafted Indian fabrics, most fancy varieties of this outfit from big fashion houses are crafted in India and then shipped worldwide. One can get the most luxurious, high-end designer sarees online at the stores of designers like Ritu Kumar and Gaurav Gupta while the more affordably priced versions, inspired by haute ramp looks, are available at branded ethnic stores and e-commerce fashion portals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center; clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/R4f4q52J9qY?showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=1&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen title=&quot;Picking the 2016 Motor&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the more westernized styles like the sari gowns are also appearing in international collections though this is still relatively uncommon; Indian designers remain the trend-setters when it comes to ethnic fashions. This international appeal, however, is not just about reaching a non-Indian customer base. In fact it is as much geared towards modern Indian women as it is towards western women. Couture fashions and designer saree blouses often make a big impact on all saree fashions, with certain innovative elements becoming a part of commonly found contemporary garments. However the biggest innovations seen in the last decade have been in blouses and this is largely because of the experimentation in designer saree blouses. Fashion mavens realized that this is an under-utilized element of the outfit, where western, indo-western and fusion cuts, colors, designs and patterns could be introduced. Many women like pairing up smart, but plain fabrics with designer saree blouses to add a modern element to their outfit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main Red Bull Instagram account posted a black square on June 2 in an online trend called Blackout Tuesday, which many celebrities used as a way of showing support for Black Lives Matter but which others criticised as drowning out discussion on the subject. However, Kozak reportedly told employees on June 17 that the brand would not make further public comments on the matter. Red Bull has not publicly commented on why Taylor and Kozak have left the company. Red Bull has not publicly commented on why Taylor and Kozak have left the company. They said Klaass' departure was part of downsizing, AdWeek reports. The June 1 letter signed by more than 300 workers asked the company to 'take meaningful action in the fight to end racial injustice' in the wake of George Floyd's killing at the hands of Minneapolis police. The company replied to the employees' letter on June 26, writing: 'We reject racism in every form, we always have, and we always will. Staff had reportedly been warned that Kozak and Taylor's jobs were under threat if any more sensitive information was leaked, after executives in Austria were thought to have blamed them for the leak of the letter. Another email written by Kozak referred to 'the murder of George Floyd and countless others' and voiced support for peaceful Black Lives Matter protests. Alexandre Ruberti and Marc Rosenmayr are said to be leading Red Bull North America until permanent replacements can be found. In a statement the company said: 'Red Bull has always put people and their dreams and accomplishments at its core and values the contribution of each and every person-no matter who they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have observed large numbers of businesses are in the market and manufacturing the jerseys for world cup matches. Various online stores are also been launched for Wholesale world cup jerseys. The cause behind is popularity of these jerseys throughout the world cup contests of any sport. If we discuss about the football, cricket or any other competition you will observe people wearing the similar jerseys to support their players. In actual fact, those who are not present in a stadium also wear these jerseys to cheer on their side as they are watching the matches at their house on television. If you are a soccer admirer then you may be aquainted with about its trend in western nations. Public madly view these matches and have on their much loved players jersey. At this point the greatest benefit goes to the wholesaler as they are in the dealing of Wholesale world cup jerseys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2018 survey of US women identified that 73% of women felt that travel makes them stronger. Now, 75% of cultural, adventure and nature travelers are female. Wonder if we can meet some or all these trends or even more somewhere in Greece? In Navarino Challenge with more than 7.500 participants &amp; visitors, the 44% are women participating in more than 30 sport activities! Moreover, these events create a &acirc;Äúcrowding-in effect&acirc;Äù - sport enthusiasts bring with them not so sportive family members, who can enjoy the non-sportive side of the venue. This is not a USA or Greek phenomenon. The 67% (2 out 3) of German Travelers said that they want to do sport activities during vacations. As sport tourism continues to gain momentum across the world, it opens up innovation avenues which can help improve the quality of life in different communities. Last but not least there will be more channels of Tourism growing with great investing like the Luxury Travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no clear definition for luxury tourism; it mainly includes qualitative services and products provided to the visitors in a convenient and extraordinary way. It is too soon to focus on these channels in Greece. The Asian luxury visitor for example is very different from the ones with European or American origin. As researches, trends and above all numbers show us there is a huge economic potential in Sports Tourism. Sports tourism is a trend that&acirc;Äôs not going away and is expected to continue growing. With sports tourism &amp; wellness travelers found to be very high-spending, high-yield tourists, there is huge potential for businesses who want to appeal to this market, creating experiences that enlighten the senses and feed the soul. Fortunately, because of Greece&acirc;Äôs wonderful landscape and history with all these great Ancient Greek Philosophers we can definitely say that sports &amp; wellness tourism is on our DNA.

Baker led Washington to the postseason in his two years there, finding quick success as he had throughout a managerial career that started in San Francisco in 1993. But after following a 95-win season with 97 victories in 2017, the Nationals fired him. &acirc;ÄúIt&acirc;Äôs almost like if you&acirc;Äôre African American, unless you win it all, then you&acirc;Äôre considered a failure,&acirc;Äù Baker said in a recent interview with The Chronicle. After Baker was let go, the only African American manager in the big leagues was the Dodgers&acirc;Äô Dave Roberts. He still is, because baseball took another pass this off-season: Eight managers were hired, and seven were white. The only minority was Carlos Beltran, now in charge of the Mets. A year ago, six teams hired managers, and none was black. Thirty-three managers have been hired over the past four years, and just two were African American, both hired for the 2016 season: Roberts and Baker. &acirc;ÄúI told somebody about 10 years ago that I saw this coming, with the decline in African American players,&acirc;Äù said Baker, who ranks 15th all-time with 1,863 victories.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Adidas Sprung Digital Quartz Unisex Watch Trendy And Fashionable - Jewelry]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The Adidas Sprung Digital Quartz ADP3213 Unisex Watch meets the world standard for digital sports watches adequately. Not just because it is lightweight and made from durable rubber and silicone but also due to its chronograph and countdown timer functions and 150 feet of water resistance that makes it an ideal wrist wear that you can wear even in the rain. On one hand, it makes for a great sport instrument that tracks and helps improve your performance; on the other, it makes for a daily casual wear. Overall, the Adidas Sprung Digital Quartz ADP3213 Unisex Watch a smart choice that will last for long and offers a good value for the money. The world of sports doesn't need an introduction to Adidas. Not even the world outside that. More so, because Adidas sportswear have given rise to a new trend altogether that has captured the heart of millions and a lot among them are not even remotely connected to sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal of the three stripes goes far beyond; so when Adidas came up with wristwatches made specifically to meet the demands of high-intensity sports, it started a new fashion trend altogether. A large number of people have opted for the Adidas sports watches by now and not all of them are fashion- or fitness-conscious by any means; instead, it is their quest for a sturdy, reliable and zero-maintenance piece for a negligible price that turned them towards the Adidas wrist watches. These technologically advanced, high-performance gears are designed to impress both aesthetically and technically; they have been created keeping a trendy, active lifestyle in mind. The Adidas Sprung Digital Quartz ADP3212 Unisex Watch came into existence following the same line, albeit trendier to go with your casual outfits over the workweek, weekends and the vacations. The Adidas Sprung Digital Quartz Watch displays regular time, day and date; alongside, it has a digital chronograph built in that tracks lap-time, individually and in total. There's also a digital countdown timer that can be used for many other time-bound tasks (e.g. tracking the parking meter) and not just for sportive activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that are backed up by a backlit LCD screen, which means, you can use the Adidas Sprung Digital Quartz Unisex Watch even under total darkness. There's rubber for the case and silicone for the strap of the Adidas Santiago Digital Quartz ADP3212 Unisex Watch while from the top, it is covered with a mineral crystal, offering optimum protection to the LCD screen. These materials keep the watch as light as possible and add a great deal of durability to the entire unit. Alongside, they are immune to dust and sweat and are easy to clean, which are essential criteria for sports-wears. The Adidas Performance Questra Digital Quartz Watch is a normal, frill-free digital watch that does more than a normal watch could. Ideal for demanding situations, it is made for the athletes but appreciated by all looking for a hassle-free and sturdy watch with a long-lasting battery life and some extra features.&lt;/p&gt;

But with the global market maturing all the time, the report&acirc;Äôs authors expect the IPO trend to continue in sports tech, even if 2019 was not the best year for public listings. &acirc;ÄúWe observed a trend towards more acquisitions and IPOs in sports tech, with mixed results,&acirc;Äù says Penkert. &acirc;ÄúWe hope that this will continue further and with better outcome. Besides that we would like to see the current &acirc;Äòtech for good&acirc;Äô trend to take over sports tech as well, for example by bringing sustainability-driven solutions to the industry.

					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;clear:both; float:right; padding:10px 0px 10px 10px; border:0px; max-width: 375px;&quot; class=&quot;wp-post-image&quot; src=&quot;https://media3.picsearch.com/is?7Y-KxsGnDwm4o7IFKVNxstbMzqtQjor9uLfVDgXd1fI&amp;width=1214&quot; alt=&quot;www.dinodirect.com&quot; /&gt;The Drum, in conversation with IBM iX associate partner Emma Chan, looks at the key marketing and trends in sports and how technology is turning sports into a data-driven, digitally enhanced sector, and how its biggest impact may be coming off the field. The Drum: What are some of the biggest trends in sports marketing for 2019 that brands should be aware of in that space? Emma Chan: Traditional sponsorship models are changing and becoming less transactional and more of a partnership with shared values and objectives, which involves creating more meaningful and personalised campaigns. Barclays Bank, Budweiser, Lucozade and Boots, as sponsors of England&acirc;Äôs Lionesses, ran various campaigns around themes of female role models and inspiring people to play football. A particular favourite of mine was Budweiser, which stated its objective to help drive real change in women&acirc;Äôs football, break down social barriers and perceptions, and showcase the women&acirc;Äôs game by building the profile and visibility of the players. The video, drawing inspiration from the words of Queen Elizabeth I and showcasing strong contemporary women, was a powerful message that has a wider impact and relevance beyond the 2019 Fifa Women&acirc;Äôs World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;

Image 97573484. - &igrave;õ&sup1;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The other trend we see is technology being used more to create really personalised experiences, and sponsored content that reaches out to fans in a very tailored way, such as behind-the-scenes footage and facts that are personalised to the fan. If you look at the Fifa World Cup 2018 Highlight Machine created by IBM for Fox Sports, this AI-powered platform lets fans create and share their own customised football highlight videos. Using this interactive platform, fans can browse and filter Fifa&acirc;Äôs archive of past and current matches by year, team, player, matches and type of gameplay, such as penalty kicks and goals. To keep post-match conversations going, fans can title, save and share their creations via email, text, Facebook and Twitter. This kind of personalised interaction creates a conversation with fans and drives more people to digital platforms, creating more opportunities to engage and therefore opportunities to generate revenue. TD: Wimbledon is cited as an example of innovating, using AI and IBM Cloud to make experiences more insightful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can the sports industry learn from this partnership? EC: Wimbledon and IBM have a 30-year history of innovation and partnership, and in that time we have collaborated to gather data - a lot of data - and from that draw insights and create engaging experiences for fans and players; 4.5m tennis data points are generated each year, and since 1990 IBM has collected, catalogued and analysed more than 66m data points. But the most important part isn&acirc;Äôt collecting the data, it&acirc;Äôs unlocking the insights within it. This provides the press and commentary teams with insight into every match and every player on every court; it provides the fans with real-time updates and analysis, and we also provide the players with personalised match analysis 20 minutes after they finish their game. For me the success of this partnership lies in a clear technology strategy aligned to business objectives and adopting an approach that is design-led and data-driven. Wimbledon wants the 70 million digital visitors each year to have the same unique experience as those lucky enough to attend in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the design of the digital channels creates an immersive experience and the data provides insights that are unique. For example, we now use IBM Watson to analyse live footage of player gestures and crowd reactions to instantly rank match highlights. Watson even listens for the ball striking the racket to make sure highlights are clipped as precisely as possible. These clips are available to the content team two minutes after a match finishes, and we are also training Watson to remove bias. TD: Just look at the changing women&acirc;Äôs game consumption habits, the pace of technological shifts and new behaviour, appetite and interest among Generation Z. The modern fans are changing sports forever. Does marketing to a sports fan require a very different mindset from marketing to a typical consumer? And how best to keep them engaged? EC: Fans want to engage with their team anywhere, any time and on any device; they want insights, highlights and content that is relevant, timely and personalised. This is aligned to their expectations as consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the fan base is growing to achieve an increasingly global reach, clubs need to broaden their appeal beyond traditional boundaries. It is no longer enough to push generic content and expect fans to stay engaged. Know your audience. It sounds obvious and many sports organisations assume they know their fans, but it is crucial to keep up with changing demographics and preferences. Rather than thinking of fans as one homogenous entity, it is important to segment them in order to respond to varied needs and tailor content accordingly. Data-driven insight (collected through interactions) enables organisations to create engaging, personalised content to attract new fans and create more advocates among existing fans. Deliver the right assets at the right time. Once a conversation is started with fans, clubs can learn about their fans&acirc;Äô preferences and start to focus on creating quality content that will engage and delight. By being more relevant, unique and insightful, clubs can keep existing fans engaged and attract new fans. Maximise the impact of digital interactions. By creating an exceptional user experience combined with bold visual design, the impact of digital interactions is immediately improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Macquarie University's Dr Dean Dudley has contributed to a new publication, Quality Physical Education, Guidelines for Policy Makers (PDF download), in which UNESCO urges governments and educational planners to reverse this trend, described by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a pandemic that contributes to the death of 3.2 million people every year, more than twice as many as die of AIDS. The Guidelines will be released on the occasion of a meeting of UNESCO's Intergovernmental Committee for Physical Education and Sport (CIGEPS) in Lausanne, Switzerland, (28-30 January). Dudley, Senior Lecturer in Macquarie University's School of Education. UNESCO calls on governments to reverse the decline in physical education (PE) investment that has been observed in recent years in many parts of the world, including some of the wealthiest countries. According to European sources, for example, funding and time allocation for PE in schools has been declining progressively over more than half of the continent, and conditions are not better in North America. The new publication on PE, produced in partnership with several international and intergovernmental organizations, advocates quality physical education and training for PE teachers. It highlights the benefits of investing in PE versus the cost of not investing (cf self-explanatory infographics). The Guidelines seek to address seven areas of particular concern identified last year in UNESCO's global review of the state of physical education, namely: 1. Persistent gaps between PE policy and implementation; 2. Continuing deficiencies in curriculum time allocation; 3. Relevance and quality of the PE curriculum; 4. Quality of initial teacher training programmes; 5. Inadequacies in the quality and maintenance of facilities; 6. Continued barriers to equal provision and access for all; 7. Inadequate school-community coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

Although we may not think much of it, eye care is something that we must all seriously consider incorporating into our regular check-up routines, as it is very important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eyeglasses play an important role in our daily lives, especially for those of us who suffer from some sort of vision impairment. In addition, certain types of eyeglasses are worn to protect the eyes from all kinds of harm and damage, while a small percentage of people wear eyeglasses for purely aesthetic purposes. Everyone is talking about healthy living these days, and people have changed their lifestyles around to accommodate time for exercising, yoga, etc, as well as healthy eating and drinking. So, do people look after their eyes, just like they do the rest of their bodies? There are millions of patients who every year correct LASIK by losing vision for myopia, farsightedness or astigmatism. LASIK refractive surgery is a cutting-edge technique that uses the excimer laser to correct many of the most common vision defects. Good vision enables us to do many things in life, which is why it is of extreme importance that you take steps to protect your vision. Eyecare is not given much prominence by the public, despite there being a number of reputable opticians. Browsing for sunglasses online?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Women With Fuller Thighs Can Look Fabulous Wearing A Pencil Skirt - Clothing]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;If you have a big pair of thighs and you are on a quest to find suitable clothing it is very much likely that you have tried donning a jeans and didn't have a very pleasant experience. Even though many women prefer to opt for pants or trousers as that allows them to fee a lot more free while on the move. But there are also many women like who are not too proud of their thighs and most of them select a nice pencil skirt to hide them. This is just a matter of perception and not a rigid norm that every fashionable women do follow as there are scores of fashion-conscious divas who feel nice and comfortable clothing in a tight-fitted jeans or even shorts. There are also millions of girls and ladies across the world who don't regard their big thighs as not one of their best features, on the contrary, many of them are happy to exaggerate how wide their thighs are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These fashion fanatic ladies also choose to wear pencil skirt and you too can follow the trend if you can choose the right dress combination. In case you are one of those women with fuller thighs who are blessed to have smaller calves, a pencil skirt can well be your best bet. These skirts are usually skin-fitted so if you don't have a huge buttock or you are not embarrassed with the shape of your hips you can give the lower part of your body a more toned look. Having said that, your attitude also plays an integral part in portraying your entire appearance as you have to walk in confidence so that you can carry the dress you have worn. You should also select your dresses and accessories with care so that you can achieve the look you want to sport. By making up your mind to put on a pencil skirt you might come across one issue that a majority of women with fuller thighs do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is the friction caused by the inner thighs as when they are on the go their inner thighs start rubbing each other and causes chaffing. However, you can easily fix this issue by wearing an inner with the shape of spanx. So it has been made clear that your big thighs cannot stop you from wearing a gorgeous pencil skirt. The parting tip that I want to share with you all who have big thighs is about the length of the dress. If you have short leg your chosen skirt shouldn't be way longer as it would make your legs appear even shorter. You also have to choose the right kind of dresses for the upper part of your body so that you can team up your attractive skirt to perfection. The best way to grab your choicest skirt is to look out for them online. Cyber shopping is the way forward these days and you would come across a myriad of online stores that sell out vintage and contemporary outfits and deliver them to their customer's place. If you resort to a reputed online shop you can get your desired skirt directly delivered at your place within a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madison's gym now has a 40-station fitness center, with treadmills, stationary bicycles, heart-rate monitors, and a climbing wall. Students wear T-shirts that say &quot;I'm Getting Fit for Life at Madison Health Club.&quot; The program emphasizes personal improvement instead of who can run the fastest mile; students run 12 minutes every week, and the teacher notes whether they increase their distances. Phil Lawler, a physical education teacher and the school's system phys-ed coordinator. Students also play some games in phys-ed class and learn about eating healthfully and avoiding health risks. Lawler, at least, thinks the efforts in the gym are paying off in the classroom as well. Naperville's eighth graders made national news in April when they scored first in the world on the science portion of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study. Lawler tells Education World. Illinois is the only state that mandates daily physical education for students in sixth through 12th grades.&lt;/p&gt;

Lawler, noting the changes in lifestyle and increase in technology that keep kids inside. Another middle school that revised its phys-ed program is in Framingham, Massachusetts. Teachers at Fuller Middle School wanted a wellness theme throughout the building and noted that students were getting less physical activity, says James Carey, the Framingham district's director of health and physical education. Administrators applied for grants to help cover renovation costs and converted a standard multi-purpose gymnasium to a fitness center with between 60 and 70 machines, including equipment for disabled students. Those students who take phys-ed twice in a six-day class cycle usually spend one day in the fitness center, Carey explains. At the middle schools without a fitness center, phys-ed teachers introduce students to lifetime activities, such as racquetball, badminton, and volleyball. Equipment including treadmills and stationary bikes, much of it donated by local fitness centers and sports rehabilitation facilities, also was added to the weight room at the high school. Carey tells Education World.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his next message, he elaborated. &acirc;Äù Then he added a smiley face. At Gaoligong, another Chinese runner, Li Yungui, was out in front at the 55K&acirc;Äôs first 10K checkpoint. A few minutes later Schlarb, Budha, and Montague followed. Bull was elated, cheering on Budha, adding playful heckles now and then to the crowds of runners bringing up the rear. After more than a year of coordination with UTMB and Chinese authorities, Toropov was thrilled. The first checkpoint stood on a grassy hilltop of brown fields manned by a local villager, Duan Shibiao, who wore a suit of camo. He&acirc;Äôd brought a small tent up the night before, and had been staking out the spot ever since. His post was simple-a yellow stand marking a fork between the different races. He&acirc;Äôd worked the test race of Gaoligong the year before, and he&acirc;Äôd heard about this year&acirc;Äôs race two months prior. Local officials had briefed the entire village on the event, and asked for volunteers. &acirc;ÄúLast year, there was a 70-year-old who ran this race!&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Archie Bradley: 'It's About Actual Black Lives  Social Injustice']]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Archie Bradley is speaking to the now and the future. The Diamondbacks closer wore a &acirc;ÄúBlack lives matter&acirc;Äù T-shirt and posted it to his Instagram page, telling anyone who didn&acirc;Äôt like it exactly what they could do with their opinions. &acirc;ÄúIt&acirc;Äôs not a movement,&acirc;Äù Bradley said in his caption. &acirc;ÄúIt&acirc;Äôs a way of life. Get with it or get lost. No other meaning here for me (than) supporting my brothers and the black community. I said get lost. Time for a change! It comes as anti-racism and social justice protests are sweeping the nation following the high-profile deaths of African-Americans including George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. The sports world has done a 180-degree turn on the matter this year. Quarterback Colin Kaepernick was vilified after taking a knee during the national anthem in the 2016 season to protest police brutality against African Americans. In baseball, superstars such as the Dodgers' Mookie Betts and Cincinnati&acirc;Äôs Joey Votto have taken a knee during the anthem. They&acirc;Äôve been supported by other big-name players including Cody Bellinger, Max Muncy and Mike Moustakas. The shift in attitudes hasn&acirc;Äôt been all-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, a few Diamondbacks players, Nick Ahmed, Andrew Chafin and Stephen Vogt, and Giants pitcher Sam Coonrod, declined to kneel with their teammates during a black-ribbon ceremony, meant to recognize the ongoing racial justice movement, that preceded the anthem. They&acirc;Äôre entitled to their opinions and should be respected for being willing to express them, even if it looks like they represent the past. Baseball has had big diversity problem. Only 8 percent of its players are African American. Only two of MLB&acirc;Äôs 30 managers are Black. And there&acirc;Äôs only one African-American front-office executive in charge of baseball operations. But the sport has focused on improving its pipeline. Four of the first 23 picks in this year&acirc;Äôs draft were African American, and two of them came from the Breakthrough Series, a diversity-focused amateur pipeline administered by MLB and USA Baseball. They&acirc;Äôre the latest numbers in a rising trend. About 20 percent of the players taken in the first round since 2012 have been Black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More work needs to be done, but when players and managers (such as San Francisco skipper Gabe Kapler) kneel during the anthem and others support them, it signals that baseball can be a safe space going forward for Black players, fans and their allies of other races. It also shows that the American public has no problem with players expressing themselves. Games on Opening Day drew nearly 7 million TV viewers combined. The Yankees&acirc;Äô 4-1 win over the Nationals drew 4 million viewers, which ESPN said was a record for MLB Opening Night. The Dodgers&acirc;Äô 8-1 win over the Giants drew 2.8 million viewers, making it the most watched regular-season late game ever. For the Diamondbacks, manager Torey Lovullo has made it clear that he supports racial equality, wearing a &acirc;ÄúBlack lives matter&acirc;Äù T-shirt before his club&acirc;Äôs first game of the season. But he supports everyone&acirc;Äôs right to their own point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width: 315px;&quot; class=&quot;wp-post-image&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.stocksnap.io/img-thumbs/960w/7U6WTBBIS9.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&acirc;ÄúGuys can have differing opinions, but I&acirc;Äôm going to support everybody the same,&acirc;Äù he said. The Diamondbacks players who decided against kneeling haven&acirc;Äôt addressed the decision publicly. Coonrod, the San Francisco pitcher, said he doesn&acirc;Äôt agree with everything he&acirc;Äôs heard about the Black Lives Matter organization and that his religious convictions prevent him from kneeling before anything but God. For Bradley, it&acirc;Äôs not about any of that. &acirc;ÄúFor me, this wasn&acirc;Äôt about a group,&acirc;Äù he said. He continued, saying, &acirc;ÄúI just view it very simply: I&acirc;Äôm not with a group; I&acirc;Äôm not with a saying. I&acirc;Äôm with what&acirc;Äôs going on in this country, and it&acirc;Äôs about the actual Black lives. It&acirc;Äôs about the social injustice. It&acirc;Äôs about the way some people are treated. It&acirc;Äôs not about hating on the cops or defunding &acirc;Ä&brvbar; For me, it&acirc;Äôs a message about this: The Black community is being treated differently. Lovullo isn&acirc;Äôt at all surprised that Bradley spoke up as he did. &acirc;ÄúHe continues to be a very vocal leader inside of our clubhouse,&acirc;Äù Lovullo said. &acirc;ÄúHe&acirc;Äôs fearless with what he believes in. That&acirc;Äôs a good thing, because Bradley is speaking to the now and future - not the past. There's plenty Moore where this came from.

Remember the physical experience. For the fans who are lucky enough to attend an event in person, it is important to make the physical experience an engaging and exciting one. Understand the fans attending and offer personalised interactions before, during and after the game. TD: Which technologies are you most excited about that you think will change the face of sports as we know it? EC: There are so many exciting opportunities to improve performance on and off the pitch using technology. Everything has to start with data - about the players, the game and the fan. Once you have that foundation the potential is vast. For me, AI in sport has so much potential to improve how we understand fans, analyse performance and create content, as well as uncovering insights and trends from data. My favourite story this year is when IBM took Watson to Leatherhead Football Club. Playing in the seventh tier of English football, it may not seem like your typical starting point for using AI, but the club&acirc;Äôs management began working with IBM Watson to provide pre- and post-match analysis, as well as opposition scouting, to coaches and players alike. Watson Discovery explores match reports and social feeds to gather information and analyse the opposition to provide a comprehensive view of their recent games, such as the most influential players, tactics for attacking and the balance between the left and right wings. Then, after a game, the Leatherhead coaches and players could ask questions in natural language to review the relevant video clips alongside insightful analysis. With Watson&acirc;Äôs assistance, Leatherhead ascended 12 spots up the league, rounding off an incredibly successful 2018/19 Season. Want to hear more on this subject? Register to attend our event in partnership with IBM here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there were the foreigners, staring at the growth from abroad, slightly confused and intrigued. In Tengchong, I&acirc;Äôd watched Catherine and Michel Poletti, UTMB&acirc;Äôs cofounders, reacting to the hubbub. Catherine appeared calmly nonplussed, while Michel frequently nodded along to the techno in befuddled amusement. When I sat down with them for tea, I asked Catherine why UTMB had chosen China for its first branded race abroad. UTMB, she told me, had never seen the number of runners from a single country increase so rapidly. For the elite foreign runners invited to the race, it was hard not to fall in love with the scene. The enthusiasm of China&acirc;Äôs new runners, the pomp, the frequent absurdities, and the energy were infectious. The potential for building a brand in a country with millions of new runners was plain to see as well. A sessions in 2015. &acirc;ÄúPeople were so hungry for information,&acirc;Äù Moehl told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&acirc;ÄúTalking to a couple hundred people at each presentation, this new insurgence-they were just all about it.&acirc;Äù Moehl thought that, since those talks, China had achieved the same progression in three years that the U.S. In Beijing that week, I got my own taste of the enthusiasm. On WeChat, Xingzhi Exploring invited all Beijing runners who&acirc;Äôd participated in the event to a reunion-&acirc;ÄúA Sharing Meeting.&acirc;Äù On a Sunday morning at 9 a.m., I showed up to watch. The meet-up was held at a swanky event-hosting office run by Xingzhi Exploring, at the north end of Beijing&acirc;Äôs Olympic Park. About 25 runners from the Gaoligong event attended, most of them wearing their official finishers&acirc;Äô jackets. For the next three hours, more than half of the group shared their race recap on stage-runners, along with volunteers and organizers-while audience members scanned their smartphones until it was their turn to share. Some of the sharers had PowerPoint presentations. A few of them cried, and another drew metaphors from famous Chinese epics on The Three Kingdoms period.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[5 Of The Biggest Sports Marketing Trends Of 2020]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Once, big-name sponsorship deals were enough to satisfy sports marketers. But amid a saturation of advertising and proliferation of new channels, fresh opportunities are arising for brands and clubs alike to cultivate deeper relationships with fans. From women's leagues to AR and eSports, the sports marketing playbook is growing into a number of new arenas. Here The Drum charts some of the biggest trends in sports marketing for 2019 that brands should be aware of when entering, or developing their work, in the space. A Nielsen Sports report stated that 84% of general sports fans find women's sport more &acirc;Äúinspiring&acirc;Äù and &acirc;Äúprogressive&acirc;Äù than the male version, which is seen by many as being more &acirc;Äúmoney driven&acirc;Äù. These figures reveal the receptiveness of the public to women&acirc;Äôs sports and the opportunity it presents for sports marketers to explore. Phil Carling, head of global football at Octagon, touches on the significance of women's football in this changing landscape for advertisers: &acirc;ÄúConsumers want their brands to stand for something and equality, diversity and inclusion would rank highly in any list of causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brands are taking heed. Nike, for instance, put women's sport at the heart of its &acirc;ÄòDream Crazier&acirc;Äô campaign at the beginning of the year. Starring and narrated by tennis legend Serena Williams, the ad is an open call for women in sports to fight back against gender bias and unfair stereotyping. Its message resonated after the controversies that plagued Williams throughout 2018, including criticism of her Nike catsuit worn at the French Open and her hotly contested loss at the US Open final. The viral hit helped to drive conversation around leveling the playing field for women in sports. Regardless of the moral reasons for supporting women's sport, it makes commercial sense for brands to capitalize on the female consumer market. Currently in the UK, women are estimated to own half the personal wealth, a figure set to grow, and they are said to influence up to 80% of purchasing decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background:rgba(0,0,0,0.1);padding:0px 10px 1px 10px;border-radius:5px;border:1px solid #000;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.trendhunter.com/slideshow/2019-sports-trends&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Top 100 Sports Trends in 2019 - Trend Hunter&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;cite&gt;www.trendhunter.com&lt;span class=&quot;eipWBe&quot;&gt; &acirc;Ä&ordm; 2019...&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;color:rgba(0,0,0,0.6);&quot;&gt;2019 &lt;em&gt;sports trends&lt;/em&gt; - The expansive list of 2019 &lt;em&gt;sports trends&lt;/em&gt; highlight a plethora of ways of athleticism, creating products, services, and experiences that make ...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This presents a huge opportunity for sports to open up their marketing appeal to women and reap the economic rewards. This surge in popularity is perhaps seen best in women&acirc;Äôs football, where earlier this year we saw huge corporate sponsorship deals inked between Barclays Bank, Budweiser and Boots cosmetics and UK female football teams and leagues. Walgreens-owned Boots entered the sport for the first time to support Scotland, England, Northern Ireland, Wales and Republic of Ireland. Helen Normoyle, marketing director at Boots UK, said: &acirc;ÄúWe are excited to give the inspirational women in these teams the chance to tell their stories and to hopefully encourage other women to experience the amazing confidence that sport can bring&acirc;Äù. This is a global trend. The Drum reported on a growth in interest for advertisers and sponsors in the Australian women&acirc;Äôs Football League earlier this year. This is due to findings that more than half of the Australian population regularly tune into women&acirc;Äôs sport, which represented a massive 48% increase on the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;

In 2017 FC Bayern Munich created a fun interface for fans where they were able to virtually insert themselves into selfies with the team&acirc;Äôs star players like Manuel Neuer or Arjen Robben. The feature was available to fans via its app, which could also personalize strips on the club&acirc;Äôs online store. This immersive experience is reported to have bumped up the club&acirc;Äôs revenue. Major League Baseball has introduced AR to its &acirc;ÄòAt Bat&acirc;Äô app, which shows data on each player including errors, fielding percentage and home run statistics when fans point their phones at the field. When a player hits a ball, the screen shows a trail tracing its trajectory with information on exit velocity, launch angle, apex and distance.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;He is one of England&acirc;Äôs best bowlers and biggest characters and is ready to play his part in cricket&acirc;Äôs &acirc;Äòproject restart&acirc;Äô. With the planned Test return against West Indies set for July, Mark Wood, 30, talked to former England captain and Sportsmail columnist Nasser Hussain about the challenges ahead. He has missed out on a World Cup, is that not enough? Nasser Hussain: First things first, what has lockdown been like for you? Mark Wood: Quite good actually. It&acirc;Äôs been nice to be in our own bubble where we&acirc;Äôve felt safe. I&acirc;Äôve got a young son who was born in October and it&acirc;Äôs been nice to spend quality time with him after two and a half months in South Africa. But I&acirc;Äôd be lying if I said I haven&acirc;Äôt been a little more anxious than normal with the way things have been. I&acirc;Äôve worried about my grandad who has bad asthma, my parents and my family going shopping and things like that.&lt;/p&gt;

But I&acirc;Äôve had time to build my fitness up so that if cricket was around the corner it wouldn&acirc;Äôt be such a big jump. Nasser: I&acirc;Äôve seen you changing nappies in cricket clothes on the internet! Wood: Well, there have been certain challenges from people and that was one of them. Dancing was another. Anything to stop us keep climbing the walls. Nasser: You&acirc;Äôre back in training now. What does that actually mean for you? Wood: We&acirc;Äôve just started training individually. I&acirc;Äôm with Stokesey at Durham but I never actually see him! He&acirc;Äôs always been in an hour before me and then I turn up and train after him. It&acirc;Äôs a weird feeling. The physio keeps two metres away but as I might need treatment on my ankle or loosening my side off I wear a mask and my hands are battered from using so much alcohol gel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&acirc;Äôs strange that you can&acirc;Äôt shine the ball. It&acirc;Äôs weird how much I&acirc;Äôve wanted to touch my face or wipe sweat on the ball or get some saliva on it. I think you take those things for granted but now it&acirc;Äôs trying to work out how to move the ball without doing that. I&acirc;Äôve been talking to Neil Killeen at Durham about looking after the ball and if we can keep it super dry maybe we can reverse it. Motivation-wise it has felt odd with no batsmen but at least we have an end goal in sight now. Nasser: How has it been for you physically? You&acirc;Äôve had injuries over the years. How long will it take you to get ready for a Test? Wood: It will take a little time, maybe a month or two. Maybe he won&acirc;Äôt agree if he reads this! But I watched a video of him the other day and he never misses the top of off-stump. He is just programmed to nail it whereas I have good and bad days trying that. I don&acirc;Äôt mind saying that my ankle does take a bit of time to get used to the workload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bowled the other day and it was a little bit sore. You have to start off at 50 or 60 per cent and build up. I can&acirc;Äôt bowl at 90 miles per hour immediately. It&acirc;Äôs like if you go to the gym, you wouldn&acirc;Äôt lift 100 kilos straight away. Nasser: It could be argued that an enforced lay-off is good for bowlers but you&acirc;Äôve missed so much cricket because of your body. Wood: Yes, over the past year when I&acirc;Äôve played for England I&acirc;Äôve felt in good form and I&acirc;Äôve been in a good place physically. I know I had a side issue in South Africa but I&acirc;Äôve been on top of the problems with my ankle and there&acirc;Äôs been a real frustration I haven&acirc;Äôt been able to continue that form. Two or three years ago I would be playing with niggles and my pace would be down and if I&acirc;Äôm at 70 or 80 per cent there are 10 bowlers better than me for England. But now my pace has been really good and I didn&acirc;Äôt want cricket to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nasser: The last time I saw you on a cricket field at the Wanderers in January you came running past me at the toss and said, &acirc;ÄòGreat, we&acirc;Äôre having a bat,&acirc;Äô because you were feeling your side. It was the second of back-to-back Tests. You were in deep conversation with Joe Root before that toss. Was it a difficult call to play? Wood: I&acirc;Äôve got a lot of trust with Rooty and we&acirc;Äôve got a good relationship. The same with (head coach) Chris Silverwood. He knows from his career what it can be like. I remember a game at Trent Bridge when I really shouldn&acirc;Äôt have played because of a bruised heel. There were others I can remember when, because of my own insecurities, I didn&acirc;Äôt want people to think I was soft. But now I&acirc;Äôm clear in my mind that if I&acirc;Äôm not fit I will say so. That morning in Johannesburg I wasn&acirc;Äôt that confident and I was thinking, &acirc;ÄòCan I do this over two innings? &acirc;Äô But when I bowled in the warm-up it was swinging and I was bowling quite sharp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sports promotions are not for baseball only; football, basketball and hockey caught on. With popular athletes like Curtis Martin, Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky leading the way in their sports, their leagues realized the merchandising potential. With the success of sports promotions, other industries caught on as well, and figurines become part of successful advertising campaigns. They serve as a constant and fun reminder of a team or an event and they are begging to be touched and played with. These days, manufacturing went a step further. You can have these dolls made to your own specifications. If you want to commemorate an event or encourage your team, many companies offer the possibility of making them to your needs. All it takes sometimes are pictures of the players and a decision of what body type and what colors you would like them to be. You can also have your mascot turned into a bobble head, or an idea you have that is not completely formed yet. Some companies will help you design, choose and approve your new creation. What started in sports became a hobby. Many people collect these dolls of their favorite players. They serve better than a baseball card that can get lost or ruined, and fetch as much, for a signed doll, as a signed card in the avid fans world.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[History Of Mixed Martial Arts]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The term MMA is delivered from Mixed Martial Arts, a unique combat sport which brings together all forms of combat to create an individual sport of its own. Primary styles which are used in MMA include boxing, Muay Thai, kickboxing, wrestling, Brazilian ju-jitsu, judo and karate. It appears that a form of MMA named pankration was a combat sport in the ancient Greek period. Ancient Greek pankratiasts were worshiped hero warriors including the legends of Arrichion, Dioxxipus, Polydamos and Hercules. Pankration first took place as an official Ancient Olympic sport in 648 BC with bouts taking place inside a combat arena which had sides of 12 to 14 feet - similar to a small modern day boxing ring. Pankration was the subject of many myths and legends. Many of the characteristics of pankration now form modern day MMA. Gladiators in Roman times often fought in coliseum battles with no weapons in a battle to the death, making it a sport with a deep history in human society. Over the past two decades there has been a significant growth in the formalisation of MMA, with organisations forming to both sanction and promote MMA simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/lVwI28YJJW4?showinfo=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen title=&quot;The Fastest People in the&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a unique feature of MMA, with other combat sports relying on a promoter to produce events, and a sanctioning body to recognise world and regional titles. The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) has been the modern day leader in producing, promotion and recognising world champion MMA fighters and events. The UFC is led by president and CEO Dana White. The UFC promotion found it difficult to get events sanctioned by state and international government regulated legislative boards, as MMA was seen as an unsavory and almost cannibalistic activity. However when White took over - after convincing business associates to purchase the fledgling business for $2 Million - he transformed both the UFC and the sport of MMA. White made effective rule changes which made event cards more attractive to state commissions, and promoted and emphasizes the athletic capabilities of the fighters, who were undoubtedly great athletes. A popular and significant part of the growth of modern day MMA was the production of the reality television series The Ultimate Fighter. The Ultimate Fighter took a behind the scenes look at the life and unique culture of up and coming MMA fighters. Most MMA contest take place inside a cage, which is primarily of octagon formation. This makes the sport exciting and fascinating for participants, spectators and followers of the sport as it create a coliseum feel like the previous gladiators of the Roman era. MMA is primarily popular in North America and regions of Asia. Recently there has been a growing trend for MMA fighters to travel to Thailand to train in Muay Thai to improve abilities in this area, as it is becoming of recognized importance. Modern day MMA stands alone as an individual sport, with an increasing presence and growing culture. There have been several attempts to migrate boxing and MMA promotions together, however given MMA uniqueness both from a sporting and business perspective it has made it difficult for supporters to become fans of both sports simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&acirc;ÄúUrgent policy action to increase physical activity is needed now, particularly to promote and retain girls&acirc;Äô participation in physical activity,&acirc;Äù says study author Dr Regina Guthold, WHO. The health benefits of a physically active lifestyle during adolescence include improved cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness, bone and cardiometabolic health, and positive effects on weight. There is also growing evidence that physical activity has a positive impact on cognitive development and socializing. Current evidence suggests that many of these benefits continue into adulthood. To achieve these benefits, the WHO recommends for adolescents to do moderate or vigorous physical activity for an hour or more each day. The authors estimated how many 11- to 17-year-olds do not meet this recommendation by analysing data collected through school-based surveys on physical activity levels. The assessment included all types of physical activity, such as time spent in active play, recreation and sports, active domestic chores, walking and cycling or other types of active transportation, physical education and planned exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highest levels of society, including national, city and local leaders, should promote the importance of physical activity for the health and well-being of all people, including adolescents. &acirc;ÄúThe study highlights that young people have the right to play and should be provided with the opportunities to realise their right to physical and mental health and wellbeing,&acirc;Äù says co-author Dr Fiona Bull, WHO. &acirc;ÄúStrong political will and action can address the fact that four in every five adolescents do not experience the enjoyment and social, physical, and mental health benefits of regular physical activity. The new study estimated for the first time how trends changed between 2001-2016 - applying the trends from 73 countries who did repeat surveys during that period to all 146 countries. The authors note that if these trends continue, the global target of a 15% relative reduction &lt;a href=&quot;https://websummit.com/stages/sports-trade&quot;&gt;in&lt;/a&gt; insufficient physical activity - which would lead to a global prevalence of less than 70% by 2030 - will not be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, Philippines was the country with the highest prevalence of insufficient activity among boys (93%), whereas South Korea showed highest levels among girls (97%) and both genders combined (94%). Bangladesh was the country with the lowest prevalence of insufficient physical activity among boys, girls, and both genders combined (63%, 69% and 66%, respectively). Some of the lowest levels of insufficient activity in boys were found in Bangladesh, India and the USA. The authors note that the lower levels of insufficient physical activity in Bangladesh and India (where 63% and 72% of boys were insufficiently active in 2016, respectively) may be explained by the strong focus on national sports like cricket. However, the US rates (64%) may be driven by good physical education in schools, pervasive media coverage of sports, and good availability of sports clubs (such as ice hockey, American football, basketball, or baseball). For girls, the lowest levels of insufficient activity were seen in Bangladesh and India, and are potentially explained by societal factors, such as increased domestic chores in the home for girls.&lt;/p&gt;

Volvo got the first safety prize, the prizes comes on and on after that. These &quot;saints&quot; drove Volvo cars, as they followed the principle of caring life. Volvo launched a car which was adopted by a &quot;saint&quot;, which is not surprising. The sport car P1800 introduced in 1958 was filled with dynamism and elegance, so Roger Moore chose it when he was staring in the English TV-serial &quot;Saint&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Sweden company noticing reality, volvo never let these properties just staying on this style car; after that, volvo also develop the car, and then develop the sport travel car - p1800 es of the style car. In 1999 April 1, Ford Motor Company acquired the Volvo car. Now volvo car using a full digital design, so designers and engineers can more quickly and intelligent to complete the project than most competitors. Today not only can a car be designed by computers, the experts of Volvo can also finish the try-out driving and impact test even before the prototype car is produced. In the coming years, cars will be changed, the whole society and people who drive the cars will change, and we have reason to believe: It is no doubt there still are vehicles in the future community, among which there will surely are the proud figures of Volvo cars.&lt;/p&gt;

How do you see Andy Murray faring in the 2011 US Open? He has the talent, he loves the hard courts and he embraces New York and the unique atmosphere of Flushing Meadows (one of the key reasons Bjorn Borg never managed to win the US). Murray is in the period of his career where he has to make good on his enormous potential and natural ability. Andy Murray can become the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sportsworldexpo.com/en&quot;&gt;World&lt;/a&gt; Number One but I think it's unlikely. He's unfortunate enough (as spectators, we are fortunate enough) to be witnessing a golden age of men's tennis in terms of quality. Federer is the most successful player of all time. Nadal, Federer, Djokovic - these guys are going to take some dislodging, and generally speaking you have to win at least one Grand Slam per year with good results everywhere else to be in with a sniff of climbing to the top of the tennis mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[As Environmental Awareness Grows]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This concern triggered two environmental initiatives: reducing the ecological footprint and using sports as a means to raise environmental awareness.Purpose of study: This presentation provides an overview of the scholarly work on environmental sustainability in sport. We present examples of environmental programs adopted by sport organizations around the world and discuss the current state of environmental efforts.Methods: Semi-structured interviews, website analysis, and published documents were used in the analysis. Data were analyzed through qualitative methods to identify themes representing the current status of environmental efforts in sport.Finding and results: Sport organizations are proactively addressing the negative environmental impact of their operations producing outcomes including increasing organizational legitimacy, averting legal recourse, saving money, and building stronger relationships with key stakeholders. Results also illustrate the challenges associated with the successful adoption of environmental programs such as communication issues and available organizational resources.Conclusions and recommendationsThe trend is for sport organizations to expand and implement current environmental initiatives. The current focus on the environment in sport is expected to continue due to social values and expectations of stakeholders, government intervention, and mandatory requirements for certain certifications (e.g., LEED). Sport organizations need to develop partnerships with industry experts and within sport leagues to continue their efforts. As environmental awareness grows, sustainable sports offer a platform from which to address these issues and contribute to a sustainable future. Keywords: environment, sport industry, sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

Popular weapons for use in hunting during this time period was forms of archery, slings and throwing spears. The gun was also used, although it had not quite yet reached full levels of popularity. On the heels of the Middle Ages was the Industrial period. This era stretched from beyond the 1700s until just after the start of the 1900s. The evolution of machines brought about great changes in hunting. Large farms became very popular, where livestock was raised instead of the practice of hunting wild animals, downgrading hunting to only become a past time. Guns, ranging from muskets to rifles, were being to be used extensively. Archery was downgraded to sport use only, though it was very popular for tests of skill.&lt;/p&gt;

Teaming&lt;wbr&gt; ...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through these stages of the history of hunting, humans have perfected this activity, with a wide range of weapons. Archers, for example, have many types of bows to choose from. Arrows are just as plentiful as bows, from metal to wood, with many different types of tips. Guns have evolved the same way, with many types of bullets and guns for different types of hunting. Special guns and equipment designed for moose hunting, for example, wouldn't be the same as deer hunting supplies. Competitive hunting, such as fox hunting, is still greatly enjoyed by many people who prefer a little more action to their hunting. In the modern world, safety and skill are the requirements for hunting, and it is open for anyone who is willing to learn proper weapon handling and obtain all of the documents necessary to hunt. Regulations on guns and hunting have been developed to prevent species from going extinct. While hunting is still very popular, the modern day has a lot more restrictions that in any other era in the history of hunting. Each of these eras of the history of hunting have done a lot for the sport and trade, giving it a rich heritage that shouldn't be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A travel zone would assist both countries' economic recovery, help kick-start our tourism and transport sectors, enhance existing sporting links, and reunite families and friends,' he added. A decision about easing national baseline restrictions will be taken on Friday, as Mr Morrison said igniting Australia's economy was vital with unemployment set to top 10 per cent. Rules on social distancing have been eased slightly in New Zealand and in some Australian states and territories but restrictions on large gatherings and non-essential travel remain. All Australian states except Victoria and New South Wales still have closed borders. Qantas Airways Chief Executive Alan Joyce said regular flights between Australia and New Zealand could begin soon after domestic routes were reopened. Qantas Airways Chief Executive Alan Joyce said regular flights between Australia and New Zealand could begin soon after domestic routes were reopened. It could be a very good model for the international market opening up in phases,' the chief of Australia's largest airline told reporters. Qantas is currently operating only five per cent of its pre-crisis domestic passenger network and one per cent of its international network. If the New Zealand bubble idea gets traction and that we're comfortable with that and that seems like it's working well, then a similar approach could be done with markets where countries have Covid-19 under control,' Mr Joyce said. It comes after trade ministers from Australia, Canada, South Korea, New Zealand and Singapore on Saturday agreed some exemptions to travel bans. The guidelines allow exemptions for 'essential cross-border travel for purposes such as maintaining global supply chains, including essential business travel', according to a joint statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the team is financially strong, it could be understood that the training equipment can be bought easily and stadiums can be maintained in better way. It would ultimately take basketball to new heights. Let's take it this way-may be you are not such a big fan of Jeremy Lin, but you know the fact that he is a popular basketball player among everyone around you. Also, with every star basketball player comes the trend of basketball jerseys that every fan would love to own. Same is the case with Lin which makes his jerseys a fan favorite product that has huge demand. So, may be you would want to buy a Lin jersey just because many of your friends and family members have one. This would keep you updated in the fashion world, and also you can make a cool style statement out of it. Many youngsters in America would want to possess a Jeremy Lin jersey, only to make it a popular gift idea.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Sport Trek: Future Sport Business In The Global Marketplace]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;To conclude this book we have returned to where we began, which is ironically the future, or more specifically, the future of sport business. As before, we argue that examining the future of sport in isolation is both naive and misleading. The future of sport should be understood within a global context. In other words, we continue to argue that it is best to extrapolate the future for sport by applying trend analysis to the world as a whole first, before arguing sport's place in that future. Throughout this book, we have used the concept of globalisation as the key driver of change and have constructed our discussion around the impact of its continued and increasing importance in the world. The following section highlights the key uncertainties facing the world in general and sport in particular. We are able to identify the nexus points through which various scenarios may come into being. Specifically, we believe that the nexus points that will mediate change include the global economy, technology and culture (or the activities of a few pivotal regions and nations along with their communication and value systems).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;		&lt;/ul&gt;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be challenges around that but as long as we can keep the atmosphere we had before and make it as normal as possible it will make a big difference. Nasser: How important will your character be? You enjoy your cricket and play with a smile on your face. Wood: I do enjoy it but at the moment Chris Silverwood has pushed me down the firm route. He wants me to be, as he says, the smiling assassin. It&acirc;Äôs not in my nature to shout and scream at people but if I can be an aggressive smiling bowler that&acirc;Äôs great. Someone like Chris Woakes is very important in this because he really looks after people. He can make light of a bad situation and help people along. Mark Saxby (massage therapist with responsibility for pastoral care) will have an important role. David Young (sports psychologist) gets on really well with everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If specialists can help with things away from cricket that will make the cricket better for everyone. Nasser: Last week was mental health awareness week. I hope you don&acirc;Äôt mind me bringing this up but I know you&acirc;Äôve struggled at times with your mental health. Have there been some really dark days for you Woody? Wood: Yes. There have been times when I didn&acirc;Äôt believe I was good enough to play for England any more and the frustration was that I cared too much about it and my own performance. I didn&acirc;Äôt think I was living up to my potential. And I struggled a lot with the injury side of things. Once I thought, &acirc;ÄòShould I just retire and give this up? &acirc;Äô It was after my third ankle op and I thought, &acirc;ÄòDo I want to go back to all that rehab? My wife has been brilliant and my dad is someone I talk a lot to about cricket. I&acirc;Äôve got a good group of friends who are not necessarily close to the game which helps. I can be myself. They bring you down if you get too high.&lt;/p&gt;

Nasser: Have you spoken to county pros who are worried about their futures, ones who are maybe coming to the end of their contract? There might not be as much money in the game after this. Wood: Yes, I think a lot are concerned about their futures. I won&acirc;Äôt give you a media-trained answer. There are young lads who might not get any cricket to prove they deserve a new deal. Everyone&acirc;Äôs in different circumstances. International cricket will have a big role to play here. If we can get it up and running it will help the counties. Durham is isolated. We&acirc;Äôre not like Surrey or Middlesex who sell out T20 every week so whatever money we can bring in will be vital. I hope with the production line Durham has had we can keep the young players coming through because it&acirc;Äôs great for the area and for England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nasser: You might need a media-trained answer for this one. Eoin Morgan this week said Alex Hales has a lot to do to get his England place back. Chris Woakes has said he&acirc;Äôd have him back. Would you be happy to have him back in the dressing room with you? Wood: Yes and no! Halesey is a fantastic player and I think the lads would accept him coming back but there seems a way for him to go yet. If he does come back what would that say to someone who has worked hard and done the right things to earn a place in the team? Would it be harsh to leave someone out for him? I felt sorry for David Willey missing out on the World Cup. He lost his place just before the tournament and I don&acirc;Äôt know what someone like Dave would think about Alex getting another chance before him. But if the barriers come down I&acirc;Äôm sure the lads would accept him, yes. Nasser: Australia have announced a lot of matches they hope to stage in their summer. What are the chances of cricket being played in England? Wood: Yes I think we&acirc;Äôve got a really good chance. There&acirc;Äôs a lot of trust in the medical staff and management. As long as it&acirc;Äôs safe - and I don&acirc;Äôt mean just players, I mean management, cameramen, caterers and everyone at the ground - then I think there&acirc;Äôs a great chance of cricket being back on. He has missed out on a &lt;a HREF=&quot;https://sportsworldexpo.com/en&quot; &gt;World&lt;/a&gt; Cup, is that not enough?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[US Backpacker Lists WEIRDEST Things He's Noticed About Australia]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;An American traveller has listed the 'weird' things about Australia - including mullets, 'shoey', misleading supermarket labels and people shopping without shoes. Backpacker Tristan Kuhn has been travelling around the country, visiting Melbourne, Tasmania, Adelaide and Cairns since moving from Texas in October. In a new light-hearted YouTube video, the 22-year-old man revealed some of the culture shocks he discovered Down Under over the past eight months. I've been here for almost a year now and as much as I love it here, I do have to say there are a couple things that Australians do that Americans may find a little bit odd,' Tristan said. Tristan said one of the strangest things he noticed is Australians walking out in public without any shoes on - yet they still get served at the shops. The weird thing about Australia is you do not need to be wearing shoes or shirt to get into most stores here. Pretty much every store in America will have a sign that says like &quot;no shoes, no shirt, no service&quot;. Well that's not the case here,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/KzkwEXj1qXM?fs=0&amp;rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;cc_load_policy=1&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen title=&quot;2010 Volkswagen CC&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you're in a Target or a Kmart or even grocery shopping, you don't need shoes or shirt, you can even queue in a bikini if you want. Tristan said Australia's iconic mullets - a popular 80s hairstyle which is short at the front and sides, but long at the back - should never return. The first weird thing about Australians is the mullet,' he said. I don't know who decided to bring the mullet back in style but dude, come on Australia, did y'all not learn from the 80s? In recent years, some Australian men have been sporting mullet cuts, which is still so popular today, Kurri Kurri, a small country town in the Hunter Region of New South Wales, hosts an annual 'Mulletfest' where thousands gather every year to honor the iconic hair style. What is the best Arnott's biscuit? Can you spot what's unusual about these sponges?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background:rgba(0,0,0,0.1);padding:0px 10px 1px 10px;border-radius:5px;border:1px solid #000;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.asoif.com/sites/default/files/download/future_of_global_sport.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Future of Global Sport - ASOIF&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;cite&gt;www.asoif.com&lt;span class=&quot;eipWBe&quot;&gt; &acirc;Ä&ordm; download&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;color:rgba(0,0,0,0.6);&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Global Trends&lt;/em&gt; Impacting the &lt;em&gt;Sports&lt;/em&gt; Sector a. ... In a fast evolving &lt;em&gt;world&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;sport&lt;/em&gt; is increasingly subjected ... While the &lt;em&gt;trend&lt;/em&gt; of new sporting formats and leagues.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plane food' for dinner, anyone? Since travelling around Australia, Tristan said one drinking game he doesn't like is the 'shoey', which involves pouring alcohol into a shoe and chugging it. It's kind of like a beer bong in America but you take an entire beer, you pour it in your shoe and you chug it out of your shoe,' he explained. I've seen a couple of them do it and a lot of them have tried to get me to do it. It's kind of nasty and I don't want a wet shoe. I mean don't get me wrong, I've done nasty drinking things too but I don't know. Shoey has long been a traditional yet bizarre drinking game in Australia, with Formula One star Daniel Ricciardo often indulging in the trend to celebrate a win. Tristan said he gets confused over the term 'footy' in Australia because it refers to three different sport - Australian football league (AFL), rugby league (NRL) and rugby union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word &quot;footy&quot; refers to different sports - depending where you are in Australia,' he said. When I was in Melbourne, everyone was talking about footy - referring to AFL, then I came up to Cairns and everyone's like &quot;oh footy season is about to start&quot; and I'm like &quot;wait, hasn't it already started?&quot;. They're like &quot;no, not AFL, like rugby league&quot;. Another thing Tristan found 'really weird' is Melbourne Cup day being a public holiday in Victoria. You guys get so much time off for a horse race. It's a big cool horse race like the Melbourne Cup it's one of the biggest horse races in the world and it takes place here in Australia,' he said. When he was coaching gymnastics in Melbourne, Tristan said he noticed the kids he coach had four to five days off during the Melbourne Cup. They did not just get that Tuesday off, they also got that Monday off of school and some of the private school kids got the Friday before.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Why Host A Tattoo Design Contest - Tattoos]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;There are several benefits of hosting a tattoo design contest. Whether participants or contest holder, all gain by this, be it an online contest or a live show. The trend these days is to sport tattoos of all sizes, making it a profitable business. Tattoo artists create the design and ink it on the client's body, and the contest host comes in contact with some fantastic designs and great artists. The contest host owns the prize-winning designs of the design contest and can convert this contest format into a big business by selling and reselling these designs to many clients. Actually, the contest host makes more out of such events than the artists do. However, artists get the recognition they don't get anywhere else, not to mention good job offers, once their work is visible in the tattoo world. This is similar to hair stylists who are celebrated for giving fabulous haircuts, or a clothes designer who, after being recognized, is hired by celebrities. Once a tattooist wins a tattoo design contest, he joins an elite group of successful people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center; clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/m5_AKjDdqaU?rel=0&amp;color=white' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen title='8 years ago (c) by MotorTrend'&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background:rgba(0,0,0,0.1);padding:0px 10px 1px 10px;border-radius:5px;border:1px solid #000;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tr.pinterest.com/pin/499829258619719569/?amp_client_id=CLIENT_ID(_)&amp;mweb_unauth_id=&amp;simplified=true&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pakistan Pacer Junaid Khan out of World Cup | Trend sport, Latest ...&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;cite&gt;tr.pinterest.com&lt;span class=&quot;eipWBe&quot;&gt; &acirc;Ä&ordm; pin&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;color:rgba(0,0,0,0.6);&quot;&gt;Feb 2, 2015 - Junaid Khan, the 25-year-old left-armer, considered one of Pakistan's most promising prospects in recent years, sustained a thigh injury in training ...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a host wants an exclusive design for himself and wants to choose from a wide selection at an economical price, hosting a tattoo contest will be beneficial to him. Here, artists participating in the contest bend over backwards to please the host by putting up exquisite designs courtesy of their creative and innovative skills. Though the host may put out a handsome amount of prize money, it won't compare with the fees a tattooist charges for a unique custom design tattoo. Artists create beautiful designs for exclusive clients, which they patent. For this, they are paid amazing amounts of money. Naturally, this means they work very hard, often in a team. Additionally, a tattoo design contest unites various talented tattoo artists under the patronage of its host. The contest host builds a good rapport with all the participating artists, and in the process, has a ready-made team of experienced artists to help him create designs for clients when required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The artists know that they have a mutually dependent relationship with the host and this makes the relationship profitable for both parties. Clients approach contest hosts for tattoos, and these contest hosts can spot the artist whose tattooing technique can fit the client's needs. For this, the contest host earns a commission. Many contests encourage live demonstrations of tattoo inking. Often, young models who can't afford to have a tattoo done offer to have themselves inked. They therefore get a free tattoo. Tattoos have always been seen as a form of self-expression. Tattoo designs lend themselves to every subject on the face of this earth, so by holding a design contest, a host brings a large number of workable ideas under the umbrella of his site. Isn't that great? However, if you too want to host a tattoo design contest, it would be wise to be aware of the pros and cons of hosting such a contest, so proceed with caution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly, some of the most successful companies in sports tech were found to operate in the booming world of fitness, which Penkert describes as &acirc;Äúone of the hottest overall tech sectors&acirc;Äù when it comes to investment. One particular success story is Peloton, the New York-based interactive indoor exercise bike company. Its public listing in September 2019 gave it a &lt;a href=&quot;https://newzoo.com/insights/trend-reports/global-esports-market-report-2018-light/&quot;&gt;market&lt;/a&gt; capitalisation of over US$8 billion, although its value has since dropped nearer to US$7.5 billion. Elsewhere, other firms like Gympass, Whoop and the aforementioned CureFit have ridden the wave of interest in fitness tech, while the likes of Strava, Tonal and Zwift have all secured significant dollars from smaller sports-focused VCs. Perhaps unsurprisingly, too, companies operating in the &acirc;Äòfans and content&acirc;Äô sector, such as the US-based fantasy sports leaders DraftKings and FanDuel, have been &acirc;Äúreeling in big bucks&acirc;Äù owing to new opportunities in that space, says Penkert. &acirc;ÄúThis was mainly due to the clear monetisation strategy and big markets that had to be captured,&acirc;Äù he adds.&lt;/p&gt;

A personal trainer in London can often can be found in some of the best sport centres in the world and the city houses many recreational areas and gyms throughout not only the centre but all over and the surrounding areas, where there are these professional and adept trainers available to assist with exercise routines. One of theses leading centres for fitness is the West-way Sport Centre and many more excellent facilities can be found in and around the beautiful city. The city itself is dotted with many active and fun areas to have entertainment and at the same time to be trained by a personal trainer, and one often sees athletes practicing and training with the aid of professionals.

&lt;p&gt;Here at Runner&acirc;Äôs World, we&acirc;Äôre pretty excited for the New Year. How could we not be, given everything that happened in 2017? We saw Eliud Kipchoge almost break the two-hour marathon barrier, and we saw American runners win for the first time in decades at Chicago and New York. But what will 2018 bring? We&acirc;Äôre hesitant to make out-and-out predictions (as runners, we know anything can happen!), but here are eight things-call them trends, phenomena, events, whatever-we&acirc;Äôve got our eyes on in the next 12 months. Watching Shalane Flanagan win the NYC Marathon was one of the top running highlights of 2017. I&acirc;Äôm psyched to see that she&acirc;Äôs not yet ready to hang up her running shoes and is planning to race the Boston Marathon in April. Shalane will be joined by an impressive pack of American women, including Jordan Hasay, Molly Huddle, Sara Hall, Desiree Linden, Serena Burla, and the legendary Deena Kastor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strength of American women distance running in 2018 looks so awesomely impressive. With that many talented, disciplined, fierce female marathoners from the U.S. The race to scale running sneaker customization is heating up in 2018. Nearly every major brand has an iron in the fire, but none have managed to perfect the system without sacrificing performance-yet. While we&acirc;Äôve seen some big breakthroughs from brands such as Brooks and Salomon, and smaller experiments from Nike and New Balance, we&acirc;Äôre still waiting to see what comes out of this quest to produce a running shoe that is truly made for you. Is it all smoke and marketing mirrors? Or could it truly transform your running experience? In 2018, smartwatches and fitness trackers will become even more precise and capable-moving from accessory devices with limited features to comprehensive digital coaches that you can wear on your run, bike ride, or even into the pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Misfit Vapor and Fitbit Ionic watches, which launched in fall 2017, give a glimpse at what&acirc;Äôs coming next. They&acirc;Äôre both water-resistant, store music, integrate with third party apps, measure heart rate, and track all kinds of activities, from running to swimming and more. The Fitbit Ionic and the Samsung Gear Sport pack in other high-end capabilities, like one- touch payments, and the Gear Sport takes things a step further with guided workouts, stretch suggestions during the day, and an integration with Speedo&acirc;Äôs new app for deeper metrics on swimming. In 2018, more runners will understand that proper recovery is part of training-it&acirc;Äôs not avoiding training. &acirc;Äôs the only time a runner&acirc;Äôs body can repair and refuel, and allow itself to adapt to the workload to reap fitness gains. Shalane Flanagan, for example, who won the New York City Marathon in November, observed that a back injury early in 2017 forced her first real break from running in a decade. When she returned from that hiatus, she felt rejuvenated and her workouts were among the fastest of her career-which resulted in her first major marathon victory.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Ever Since The Advent Of Facebook]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.groundreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Winter-Fashion-1200x675.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Best Winter Fashion Trends For 2016&quot; class=&quot;wp-post-image&quot; style='clear:both; float:left; padding:10px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px; max-width: 330px;'&gt;If you are working in the media and sports is your forte, chances are you have been asked this question already: what do those involved in covering sports do when there is no live action? The year 2020 has been surreal for almost everyone around the world for various reasons, and sports is no exception. Coronavirus has led to unprecedented events this year, the kind of impact on the sporting world not seen since World War II. No one in the sporting industry - be it the athletes and their families, coaches, support staff, officials, broadcasters, journalists, agents or those working in stadiums - was ready for this. No one could have predicted that an Olympic year, a dual T20 World Cup year, a European Championships year would end up being the year where sporting action reaches a grinding halt. But in the midst of all this, a new trend has emerged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One that has kept athletes, fans and even those covering the game engaged. Many sportspersons around the world have stepped up their social media game, reaching out to their followers not just about their personal routines but turning interviewers as well. And it makes one wonder if the coronavirus lockdown, not just in India but around the world, could permanently change the way sportspersons interact with fans. In these tough times, lift yourself up with inspiring stories from the world of sports. Ever since the advent of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, athletes have said how social media has been a tool to bring them closer to their fans. In the past, this has often been a double-edged sword: with instances that show how it can be put to good effect or occasions that made you wish the athletes would just do their thing on the field of sports. But now, with no sporting events to participate in or even prepare towards, these superstars have taken the opportunity to interact with each other on live video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is no secret that Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal adore each other, but their interaction on Instagram was enough to send tennis fans around the world into a frenzy. Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray constructing their favourite tennis player was one among the many great moments during their live chat. Away from tennis and closer home, cricket stars have been on overdrive in chatting with each other from the comforts of their homes. Be it former Indian stars reminiscing about old times like Yuvraj Singh and Harbhajan Singh or current cricketers and modern greats, like AB de Villiers and Virat Kohli sharing their bromance. One of the more unique interview formats that we have seen is on YouTube. The ever-so-social-media-savvy Jemimah Rodrigues and her partner-in-crime Smriti Mandhana have started a series titled &acirc;ÄòDouble Trouble&acirc;Äô where they released a couple of video interviews, featuring badminton world champion PV Sindhu and India vice captain Rohit Sharma. Also read: Sunil Chhetri interacts with IM Vijayan, Sania Mirza and Virat Kohli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background:rgba(0,0,0,0.1);padding:0px 10px 1px 10px;border-radius:5px;border:1px solid #000;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nielsen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Nielsen_Top5_Commercial_Trends_2018.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;top 5 global sports industry trends - Nielsen&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;cite&gt;www.nielsen.com&lt;span class=&quot;eipWBe&quot;&gt; &acirc;Ä&ordm; 2019/04&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;color:rgba(0,0,0,0.6);&quot;&gt;When we first sat down to discuss the &lt;em&gt;trends&lt;/em&gt; affecting the &lt;em&gt;sports&lt;/em&gt; business in 2018&lt;wbr&gt;, it was clear that the most significant of these had been with us for some years.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Indian cricket fans, this concept is not entirely new. This is now becoming the norm, with inter-sport discussions too. With Rodrigues and Mandhana,for instance, the standout feature so far has been how comfortable their subjects have been in discussing various issues. While Rohit has always been outspoken, Sindhu&acirc;Äôs demeanour in her interview was a breath of fresh air. These times represent a great challenge for sports journalists. Players are doing what journos do and they have greater access and obvious camaraderie. Journos can either accept this situation, play second fiddle and live off quotes, or raise their game significantly. Which brings us to the question: is this the new normal? Sure, the players who are interacting with each other could have the same marketing agency representing them or common brands they endorse. The questions will still be vetted to some extent. With the level of comfort athletes have with each other more evident, fans have been able to see a different facet of their personal lives. Apart from a selection of senior journalists around the country, very few can guarantee that sort of comfort to a sportsperson that one of their peers can offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is, therefore, not a massive surprise to see Sindhu open up (even if briefly) about the pressure she was under in Basel in 2019 or, more strikingly, Mohammed Shami reveal his mental battles to colleague and friend Rohit Sharma. The biggest takeaway? The guard that these media-trained superstars erect before the media (mainstream or otherwise) has invariably been dropped. The absence of scrutiny - no constant press conferences, questions about performance and pressure of tournament - has freed these sportspersons in a way that is enabling them to talk even about failures candidly. This means that fans can have an honest insight into the personality of an athlete so often hidden in the grind of the fast-paced sporting life and the necessity to maintain a certain persona on social media. It&acirc;Äôs been a long time since athletes, especially in India, have been able to have conversations without questions and answers invariably twisted for catchier headlines. This new, unique format therefore shines a light on the authentic selves of sporting idols. Sure, the authenticity of a good interview with an unbiased, well-trained journalist will be tough to replicate. Sure, brands and agencies could seen realise that these interactions could also be money-making opportunities, and that might dilute the spontaneity over time, but the temptation to make these more regular will be high. For now, the real winners might be fans, who get to see the their personal athletes more up close and personal than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Grosgrain Ribbon Is The Feather Of Any Classy Garment - Craft]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;

Most of the time people make use of various elements to make this happen. There are various factors which come into play when an individual makes the effort to make an impact on others.

&lt;p&gt;So every single kid had four days off of school at least and some had five,' he said. The Superbowl is like one of the biggest most watched sporting event in the world and we don't even get a public holiday or time off. Not hating on the fact that y'all get time off. Tristan said when he first moved to Australia, he noticed how different the country's electrical outlets with on/off switches were compared to the US. I personally found this kind of weird when I came here. Every single one of your outlets has like an on/off switch,' he said. So you can turn the electricity to the outlet on or off. I don't really get this because if you want to turn something off, you usually just turn it off like a lamp or if you didn't want to hit the switch to turn it off, you can like unplug it. But here, there's also a third way to turn it off - you can go to the little outlet and switch it off. For some reason a lot of Australians like to turn things off by turning the switch off which I don't like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there an advantage to that? In Australia, anyone aged 18 or over must vote or they face a fine. Voting in Australia is mandatory. If you don't vote, you get fined. In America and in most other Western democratic governments, voting is like a freedom, like a right. However in Australia, I think it's kind of more of an obligation,' he said. The fines aren't crazy expensive - it differs between state and national election - but either way, I think it's kind of crazy that you can get fine to not vote. In America, there is a problem with people not voting so I get why you would do that. I think if this was in America, like we already have a bunch of idiots, we don't need all idiots being forced to vote. Tristan said another thing he noticed in Australian supermarkets are the misleading shelf labels with either 'discounts' or 'savings' printed on them. This is super specific but this is like American weird, this isn't Australian weird but if you go to a grocery store here like Coles and Woolies, I've noticed this in both, everything looks like it's discounted,' he said. But it took me a long time to realise this - some of them are yellow and some are red and white. Upon closer inspection, Tristan said he realised the red and white tickets actually show a permanent 'price drop' with a date showing the previous retail price. If you look closely, you'll see a date and that date might be six months ago, it might be a year or two years ago - doesn't matter when, it just means that the price was higher on that date,' he said. This little trick is a way to make you think you're getting a deal when you're really not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PPM&acirc;Äôs Boeder also sees regional differences again at play among competing OEM brands. &acirc;ÄúThe Mississippi River can be considered the general line of demarcation,&acirc;Äù he said. Maverick X3 and Yamaha YXZ 1000R. Across the river, the eastern half of the United States is more densely populated and offers much smaller wooded areas in which to recreate. Incidentally, such variations extend to motorcycles as well. &acirc;ÄúOff-road motorcycle enthusiasts in the deep woods of Tennessee certainly have their bikes set up differently than folks riding the rocky trails of Utah,&acirc;Äù Boeder said. As OEM participation has broadened, the UTV consumer demographic has undergone a seismic shift also. &acirc;ÄúIt used to just be the more middle-aged and older group that was using a side-by-side because of the &acirc;Äòold with age comes a cage&acirc;Äô adage,&acirc;Äù explained Martinez at Team Alba. &acirc;ÄúIt was a safer vehicle. Nowadays, heck, they&acirc;Äôve started development of side-by-sides down to 170 cc, where kids are getting involved and driving right next to their parents in their own vehicles. In regard to aftermarket purchasing habits, SEMA market research indicates that about 82% of UTV owners have purchased or plan to purchase upgrades to their UTVs, with accessory decisions made early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, most purchases occur within the first three months. Enhancing functionality is among the top priorities, especially since UTVs are frequently used year-round for varied activities across diverse terrains. Moreover, UTV owners are often focused on safety over speed, durability over performance, and practicality over excitement, as evidenced by the most popular upgrades: hitch balls, tow hitch receivers and rearview mirrors. &acirc;ÄúAs one would suspect, utility-oriented modifications are also very popular with off-road enthusiasts, whether motorcyclists, UTV operators or sledders,&acirc;Äù agreed Boeder at PPM. &acirc;ÄúHere we&acirc;Äôre looking at auxiliary lighting, racks and other storage solutions as well as specialized tools, self-recovery items, etc. For those supplying the market, UTVs are the most promising segment. Although a practical bunch, UTV owners don&acirc;Äôt shy from a thrill or two. &acirc;ÄúPowersports enthusiasts have always strived for more performance out of their vehicles of choice, so we do believe that easy bolt-on modifications such as intakes and exhausts, suspension bits and tires and even ECUs are often among the first items to be modified utilizing aftermarket products,&acirc;Äù Boeder observed.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;If you haven't yet perfected your digital marketing strategy, you need to get onto it quick-smart in the new year. 2017 was the year in which the social media marketing trend really took hold, and in 2018, it was all about building on that strong foundation. In 2019, it's time to come up with the goods and make your digital marketing the best it can be.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width: 325px;&quot; src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/The_World%27s_fair%3B_its_meaning_and_scope%3B_its_old-world_friends%2C_their_countries%2C_customs_and_religions%3B_what_they_will_exhibit_%28IA_worldsfairitsmea03cutl%29.pdf/page1-83px-The_World%27s_fair%3B_its_meaning_and_scope%3B_its_old-world_friends%2C_their_countries%2C_customs_and_religions%3B_what_they_will_exhibit_%28IA_worldsfairitsmea03cutl%29.pdf.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The World's fair; its meaning and scope; its old-world friends, their countries, customs and religions; what they will exhibit Author Cutler, H. G. (Harry&quot; class='wp-post-image'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Augmented Reality: This is an area set to grow dramatically in 2019. Thanks to the gaming sector, it is already in use but expects to see more of it on social media and websites. A quick example would be Snapchat's facial filters. Live Video: This is already working well in digital marketing and will be used more widely in website design in 2019. It was 2016 when the number of internet users watching live video shot up to 80%. In 2018, 45% of internet users said they would pay to see online streaming of sport and live performances. Chat-bots: The best digital marketing strategies in 2019 will make more use of chat-bots. There are plenty of survey results from 2018 to show internet users love them and want more. From a business point of view, it's a winner, as it will save you money whilst offering your customers solutions and products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generation Z: This group will be entering the workforce in 2019, creating an enthusiastic new market for many products. With money to spend, Generation Z was born into the world of social media and will be attracted by clever technology and marketing. Google Marketing Platform: By launching this Google has upped the ante on search marketing. AdWords has been renamed Ads, and other tools like Google Analytics and AB testing have been better integrated. Google's Speed Update will also affect digital marketing in 2019 so keep an eye on that. Social Media: The three main networks will be Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. Interestingly, the biggest group of users on Facebook now is the 55-plus age group. For other age, groups usage will stay static or even fall. However, digital marketing strategies will make more use of Messenger. Around 1.3 billion people use Messenger every month now, with 8 billion messages exchanged between people and businesses over that same time period. Instagram usage is set to increase across all age groups, but in particular, 25-34-year-olds and the 18-24 age group. Snapchat appears to have come of age. Once the realm of teens only, it is now attracting users across most age groups, although the frequency of use is still questionable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Businessmen also have decided to cash on the opportunity and have launched a diverse range of women sportswear. This range of women sportswear is available in exotic shades, prints and patterns. The fashionable sportswear has become quite popular among the modern youth who want to create a style statement and want to look their best.

The trendy and innovative designs in fashion sportswear has also enticed the youth to wear them as casuals. The use cutting-edge technology has also assisted in the manufacture of an exclusive range of sophisticated women's sportswear. The advantage of this variety of sportswear light in the light weight features that do not hamper free body movement of the player. These are entirely designed for complete flexibility and freedom to play. For instance, the sportswear designed for judo and karate women players is fabrcated to suit the structure of a woman's body. In the same vein, an athlete, badminton player or a table tennis sport player would demand for a comfortable and light weighted sports wear clothes to give full concentration on the game only. Cloistering attire on the other hand, would only result in distraction and inconvenience. Moreover, the internet has become a hub for acquiring women sportswear of all varieties. The modern sports wear clothes has revolutionized the complete outlook of the appearance of the sportswomen. They no longer have to deny their feminism in a bid for gaining the respect of their peers in a previously male-dominated sports world. Now the sports women look equally stunning and appealing as any other top celebrity while they play.&lt;/p&gt;

The cultural and economic shifts that have led middle class urbanites to run recreationally still haven&acirc;Äôt arrived in the countryside, which is drastically underdeveloped compared to China&acirc;Äôs cities. In remote areas of China, the competitions are still a spectacle of awe. One runner I met named Li Zhaoyang, who had grown up in rural Yunnan and later moved to the sprawling provincial capital-as many young Chinese born &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.marketresearch.com/top-trends-to-watch-in-the-global-sports-industry&quot;&gt;in&lt;/a&gt; the countryside do-rarely bothered to explain to her mother who still lived back home why she ran. Along the course, volunteers from local villages mixed in with young city-dwellers flown in from around the country, a rare blending of the two. The villagers had been provided with blue tents, and they all mentioned the briefings government officials and race organizers gave them. For Tengchong, many said this was the biggest event of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[The Biggest Trends In Gyms And The Fitness Industry]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;With the concepts of wellness and mindfulness becoming ever more important for consumers, fitness has become a more relevant goal for many people. Work done by LatentView Analytics looked at approximately 150 million data points including information on products, product usage, product reviews as well as search terms and social media conversations over the last 10 years. Working out at home is not a trend. It is a seasonal fad that peaks in the winter months when people have made New Year&acirc;Äôs resolutions and home workouts are not likely to grow overall. There are a few companies that have grown rapidly in the home workout market and they are rare exceptions. Most notable is Peloton but most other equipment makers are targeted at clubs or have not been nearly as successful as Peloton in reaching consumers buying home workout equipment. Community in gym workouts is the top motivator for consumers to go to gyms. If you have just about any inquiries relating to where along with how to work with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.detik.com/&quot;&gt;trend sport world&lt;/a&gt;, you are able to e mail us with our webpage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width: 350px;&quot; class='wp-post-image' src=&quot;https://burst.shopifycdn.com/photos/compass-held-above-world-map.jpg?width=746&amp;format=pjpg&amp;exif=0&amp;iptc=0&quot; alt=&quot;Compass Held Above World Map&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Technology development in fitness is growing and consumers are driving that growth. Although technology is not spurring more interest in home workouts, fitness apps are widely used at gyms and in outdoor workout and fitness settings. Fitbit is the best known of such devices; interest in that specific product has peaked. Google has agreed to buy Fitbit, no doubt to leverage the health information it has gathered. I recently caught up with my colleague, Kim Karmitz, who has been studying the fitness industry and is on a related panel of experts for the upcoming Fitness and Active Brands Summit next month. That conference is awarding innovative fitness startups and, not coincidentally based on the LatentView data, its awards are largely to fitness technology companies. The technology driving fitness now breaks down into three categories: performance improvement, experiencing the gym in new ways and marketplaces. Two companies are using new technology to help amateurs be better at their sport with real-time, personalized instruction that uses artificial intelligence (AI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background:rgba(0,0,0,0.1);padding:0px 10px 1px 10px;border-radius:5px;border:1px solid #000;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://visua.com/sports-sponsorship-trends/&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sports Sponsorship Trends for 2019 - visua-logo&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;cite&gt;visua.com&lt;span class=&quot;eipWBe&quot;&gt; &acirc;Ä&ordm; sports-sponsorshi...&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;color:rgba(0,0,0,0.6);&quot;&gt;The &lt;em&gt;world&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Sports&lt;/em&gt; Sponsorship has seen much growth in the last couple of years. So what &lt;em&gt;trends&lt;/em&gt; should we expect to see in 2019? Esports sponsorship has&lt;wbr&gt; ...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the video below, the female voice you hear is an AI program created by a company called Asensei which puts sensors in your workout clothes to monitor your movements. It can then give you highly specific instructions about how to move your body based on what it senses through your clothing. At the moment, it works for yoga and rowing and Asensei is developing other sport modules. Asensei is working with apparel manufacturers to incorporate its technology into branded garments. A different approach to market is being taken by another company, Sensoria whose founder previously ran a $14 billion business at Microsoft. Sensoria has taken an &acirc;ÄúIntel inside&acirc;Äù approach to developing a platform for wearables of all types that uses artificial intelligence to help amateur athletes perform their sports better. The video below demonstrates how Sensoria helps a runner perform better, faster, safer, with greater endurance. Sensoria&acirc;Äôs software can be incorporated into any garment or footwear by a manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two companies are changing the way gyms are experienced. One brings gaming into gyms. If you&acirc;Äôre over 40, Black Box VR will not be very interesting. But if you&acirc;Äôre under 40, it will be one of the most interesting, exciting things you&acirc;Äôve ever seen. A user in a gym puts on a virtual reality headset and attaches to weights made for the purpose. A video game begins in which there&acirc;Äôs no hand-held controller, the user&acirc;Äôs body movements control the game. As the user moves, the weights are lifted. Because of the weights a user gets a complete workout by the time a game is over. If you love playing video games but are not highly motivated to work out in a gym, this will bring you in and keep you there. Like other video games, it is always changing and evolving based on your skill. It is designed to be played either against the computer or against other people who can be either nearby or anywhere else in the world. The video below demonstrates. Another company called Forte moves the gym class to any other location in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It installs hardware and software into workout studios and gyms to bring live and on-demand fitness classes to consumers when they can&acirc;Äôt make classes at the gym. Interestingly, Forte has found that consumers prefer live classes because they are real and authentic over recorded or repeated content. Consumers want new content all the time and don&acirc;Äôt want to watch a repeat of exercise classes they&acirc;Äôve already taken. It&acirc;Äôs consistent with the LatentView data indicating that social experiences are a key driver of gym memberships. Like so many other sectors, gyms and fitness are seeing the development of marketplaces that match providers with users. One of those is Athlete&acirc;Äôs Guide, a digital marketplace that connects NCAA athletes with high school athletes to help them train better and mentor the younger athletes. The appeal of the experience is for high school athletes to work with a role model in something that the younger students are highly engaged with.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Surfing Lessons In Oahu]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Wish to learn to surf in Waikiki Beach but-don&acirc;Äôt understand how to start? Surf school Oahu Island is about getting you to another stage it doesn&acirc;Äôt matter how much expertise you have. It is about conquering anxiety, understanding water security, understanding more about wave and ocean, and the real essence of surfing - rest and enjoyment! It&acirc;Äôs never late to learn how to surf. People, young or old are attracted to the majesty of our lovely oceans lovely. It is time for you to look for a teacher should you be excited about surfing! Learn to Surf - Obtaining a Professional. The internet is a superb spot to locate surf instructors in Oahu Island and find out about their skills as well as backgrounds. Aside from your reason behind searching for a surfing instructor there are certainly a few things that you should look at: an extended record of surfing, updated medical accreditation, certified surf experience, along with a comprehensive understanding of wave, climate and wind conditions. There are lots of exceptional surfing teachers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background:rgba(0,0,0,0.1);padding:0px 10px 1px 10px;border-radius:5px;border:1px solid #000;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ispo.com/en/trends&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The latest trends in the sports industry - ISPO.com&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;cite&gt;www.ispo.com&lt;span class=&quot;eipWBe&quot;&gt; &acirc;Ä&ordm; trends&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;color:rgba(0,0,0,0.6);&quot;&gt;For the first time, H&amp;M is collaborating with an all-female surf community, to help empower and inspire togetherness amongst women all over the &lt;em&gt;world&lt;/em&gt;. Teaming&lt;wbr&gt; ...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several have at least invested their time in the water to truly have an understanding of the needs of the sport. If you are a bit more serious in surfing, or need the entire surfing experience within the fingers of the correct professional, there are lots of professional/ex-professional who are able to guide your improvement and assist you to obtain the most from the surfing experience. Perhaps you are thrilled and prepared to surf, but been haste. It may be attractive - particularly in instance when you have buddies that surf or a beachside area - to simply get a surfboard. This can be a poor strategy for two factors: One, it is easier to understand the proper way to complete things originally than to correct poor practices and, two, you do not wish to invest your hard earned cash on surfing equipment (and, particularly, on the surfboard) before you have had some instruction and encounter, since you will not understand what board best fits your type of surfing. Several surf schools will give you gear to work with. Should you run into one which does not then it is often not impossible to get the required gear from the surf shop. Attend a handful of Oahu Island surf lessons first, perhaps get one of these diverse surfboards of numerous sizes and shapes, after which you choose a board that you believe is better for you personally. Your teacher also needs to be pleased to provide you with guidance on how to surf. Many surfers may let you know that surfing is significantly more than a sport; it could be addictive, and it is an existential encounter. Therefore get yourself a teacher, suit-up, garb a suitable board and struck the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-post-image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.ispo.com/sites/default/files/styles/facebook/public/2019-01/ISP_pr_2019_Wintersport.jpg?h=e5aec6c8&amp;itok=2vEfdnNt&quot; alt=&quot;Digital, individual, and sustainable: winter sports trends f&quot; style='clear:both; float:left; padding:10px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px; max-width: 360px;'&gt;With no expectation of succeeding in the first of those disciplines, he stacked a floor routine with his hardest manoeuvres - and to his obvious surprise he executed it in a way he never expected to set up the most unlikely of doubles. Smith, meanwhile, broke down in tears after silver in the pommel. He has four Olympic medals and none are the gold he wants most. While Ryan Lochte dreamt up a scenario, Roy Jones Jnr lived it at the Seoul Olympics of 1988. He obliterated South Korea&acirc;Äôs Park Si-hun in the light middleweight final, landing 86 punches to 32 and forcing a standing eight count in the second round. When the verdict went to the home fighter by split decision, it is said Park apologised to Jones Jnr. In a sport rife with corruption, in which Olympic boxing has seen some of its worst, this ranked as the oddest result of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones went on to be one of the greatest fighters of all time. Even Russia don&acirc;Äôt make cheats like they used to. What played out in the modern pentathlon at the 1976 Olympics is unlikely to ever be matched for sheer skulduggery. It centred on Boris Onischenko, a true great of the sport who was a three-time world champion and part of the gold-medal winning Soviet team of 1972. Within that orbit, few could match him with a fencing sword in hand. All of which made the events that played out more remarkable. There had been a suggestion something was amiss when Onischenko appeared to miss the British athlete Adrian Parker by a couple of inches and yet the scoring light illuminated for a hit. But it was odder still when Parker&acirc;Äôs team-mate Jim Fox stepped up against Onischenko and the same thing happened. &acirc;ÄòBoris tried it on the wrong bloke with me,&acirc;Äô Fox would later say. He had felt something was dubious in the manner Onischenko had apologised, and also in the way he had wanted to change his sword once it had drawn attention.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[People Take To Their Bikes When We Make It Safer And Easier For Them]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;clear:both; float:right; padding:10px 0px 10px 10px; border:0px; max-width: 390px;&quot; alt=&quot;2015 Motor Trend International Auto Show..040&quot; src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/8580/16102755259_1b5deb1a65_b.jpg&quot;&gt;However, our recent research shows some exceptions to this trend, in places where safe cycleways have been built. While many of the world's cities are investing in cycling, Australian cities are pedalling backwards. Cycling targets may appear in planning documents, but federal and state governments have clearly failed to commit adequate resources to achieving these goals. Governments tend to see cycling as sport, recreation or a children's activity, rather than as an essential part of a modern multi-modal transport system. It was refreshing to hear New South Wales state MP Geoff Lee lauding the opening of the Parramatta Valley Cycleway. The cycleway connects vast areas of his electorate with Parramatta CBD, Western Sydney University, Westmead Hospital, Olympic Park and many schools and rail stations. However, as well as commending the project for giving &quot;local residents, cycling and fitness enthusiasts more ways to enjoy and explore our beautiful local area&quot;, Lee could perhaps have said more about its huge transport potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PLBM9p8DUCg/hqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Jean Todt Owns A Ferrari 250 SWB Covets Ralph Lauren's Ferrari 250 GTO Ferrari Video 2019 - &euml;èô&igrave;òÅ&igrave;ÉÅ&quot; class='wp-post-image' style='max-width: 390px;'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Many of the trips we make around our cities - for work, school, shopping, visiting friends, getting to a train station - are less than two kilometres. Given adequate facilities - and perhaps a more liberal approach to cycling regulation - many of these trips could be easily (and quickly) made by bicycle. If more of us were cycling for transport, we could expect to see some reduction in heart disease, diabetes and stress levels, and an improvement in our overall wellbeing. More of us could be liberated from sitting in perennial traffic congestion. More businesses could increase their productivity by switching to bicycle delivery, as Domino's Pizza has done. Innovative business ventures, like recently launched app-based bike-share services (Reddy Go and oBike), might be more likely to succeed. The national cycling participation data show NSW now has the smallest proportion of people cycling in &lt;a href='https://www.sportaus.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/665857/34871_Connecting_Digital_with_Sport_Final_V3.pdf'&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. However, this varies widely from area to area. Our research shows residents of some parts of Sydney are bucking the trend and riding more often. And the key reason is investment in cycleways by councils such as the City of Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also observed residents living in similar suburbs west of the CBD, where no new cycleways were built during this time. This type of study is known as a natural experiment, which can help isolate the effects of an intervention (in this case a new cycleway) from the effects of background factors (more on these below). We found that, while cycling decreased elsewhere, people living closest to the cycleway continued to cycle and cycled more frequently. Those living a little further away - between 1km and 3km from the cycleway - actually increased their weekly cycling, compared with those either closer to or further from it. Data from biannual bicycle traffic counts corroborated these findings. These showed that bicycle traffic at one point on the cycleway more than doubled after it opened, while the average count across the city declined somewhat. Even when adjusting for uneven population growth, cycling along the route clearly increased relative to areas with no investment in new facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that our study coincided with major changes to Sydney's transport environment. A new public transport ticketing system, the Opal smartcard, was introduced in 2014, which made public transport more attractive. Major changes were made to bus routes in 2015, to allow construction of light rail along the CBD's main thoroughfare (George Street). At the same time, the state government demolished the College Street Cycleway, one of the busiest commuting routes in the city, to create space for more traffic. The government announced steeply increased fines for cycling infringements, as well as plans to force people to carry ID when cycling. Police stepped up enforcement of even the most trivial of cycling offences. Despite these measures being justified on safety grounds, the cycling injury rate appears to have since increased. This array of background factors highlights the importance of our natural experiment approach, and may explain why cycling rates fell in areas with no new infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although transport cycling (as opposed to sport cycling) is relatively safe, concerns about safety and fear of traffic are among the main reasons people give for not riding. A connected network of protected cycleways and quiet streets across a city allows people to get to more places by bicycle, without feeling intimidated by traffic. This is the underlying philosophy of the City of Sydney's cycleways strategy. It's also the first step in enabling the average Australian to use a bike for everyday transport. At a time when government spending on transport and health care is ballooning, our research shows a relatively small investment in cycling infrastructure could give many more people the option to make short trips by bicycle. But it would help if legislators considered proven measures for protecting people who are considering cycling for transport. It appears punitive fines and heavy-handed policing simply drive them straight back onto crowded roads and trains - while doing little or nothing to improve safety.

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Sports Betting Rule - Know Your Rules]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Betting on sports is one of fastest growing transactions in the world today. Some say that it destroys the beauty of the sport, be it basketball, baseball or football, while some would also say that it makes the sport more exciting by having a bet on its outcome, one is thereby allowed to give flavor to the sport. If you are a sports enthusiast, it may make betting on sports an interesting experiment to spice up your sports life. If you're not the type of person who is familiar with any sport, then this may be interesting to you insofar as the outcome of the game would become more personal to you and as such, interest thereof may be amplified. Betting on sports has come a long way. From the time of the ancient Greeks up to now, sports betting has always been a constant trend. This is because betting on sports adds flavor to it. Perhaps you may be wondering as to the meaning of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center; clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vDtwxMgR7DE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;modestbranding=1&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen title=&quot;20 MOST EMBARRASSING MOMENTS IN SPORTS&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, it is an established rule that by watching sports people get exited especially if the game that their favorite team is in is a crucial one. An example of this is a game 7 in the NBA Championship. Imagine feeling this excitement taking into consideration the fact that you won't actually lose anything in case your team suffers a loss. Now imagine if you have your money in the game. Just imagine the thrill of possibly winning or losing with your team. In which case, there will be actual winning or losing on your part by way of your money. But those who place their bets in a wise manner actually win more than they lose without having to sweat for it. The only investment is your money and your voice becoming hoarse for shouting your heart out every time your team makes a goal or scores a basket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background:rgba(0,0,0,0.1);padding:0px 10px 1px 10px;border-radius:5px;border:1px solid #000;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.trendhunter.com/slideshow/2019-sports-trends&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Top 100 Sports Trends in 2019 - Trend Hunter&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;cite&gt;www.trendhunter.com&lt;span class=&quot;eipWBe&quot;&gt; &acirc;Ä&ordm; 2019...&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;color:rgba(0,0,0,0.6);&quot;&gt;2019 &lt;em&gt;sports trends&lt;/em&gt; - The expansive list of 2019 &lt;em&gt;sports trends&lt;/em&gt; highlight a plethora of ways of athleticism, creating products, services, and experiences that make ...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is in this wise that you should know the sports betting rule. The sports betting rule is that you should know the different teams. The teams that you placed your money with as well as the team that you betted against. It is a sports betting rule to know these teams. The importance of knowing these teams is for you to determine whether you are betting wisely or not and for you to calculate the probability of winning. It is also a sports betting rule to know the conditions of the players of the team. This is important so that you'll have an idea of how the game would unfold. For instance, if a team has a star player and without such player, said team would likely lose or would likely not be able to score more than 80 points in a game, then the absence of that player, maybe through injury or for any other cause, would allow you to have an inkling of the outcome o the game and thereby allow you to calculate whether betting on that team would be wise or not. These are the sports betting rule that you should remember so that you chances of winning in sports betting would improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&acirc;ÄúThe trend of girls being less active than boys is concerning,&acirc;Äù said study co-author Dr Leanne Riley, WHO. To increase physical activity for young people, governments need to identify and address the many causes and inequities - social, economic, cultural, technological, and environmental - that can perpetuate the differences between boys and girls, the authors said. &acirc;ÄúCountries must develop or update their policies and allocate the necessary resources to increase physical activity,&acirc;Äù says Dr Bull. &acirc;ÄúPolicies should increase all forms of physical activity, including through physical education that develops physical literacy, more sports, active play and recreation opportunities - as well as providing safe environments so young people can walk and cycle independently. This study was funded by the World Health Organization. It was conducted by researchers from WHO, Imperial College London, and the University of Western Australia. The authors note some limitations, including that the study only included information from school-going adolescents, due to lack of data for adolescents out of school. School-going adolescents may vary from others of the same age, as adolescents in school may be more likely to come from advantaged backgrounds that may be more focused on high achievement in other academic disciplines, rather than physical education and sport. Further, while the study covered 81% of the school-going adolescent population, this coverage varied by country income, ranging from 36% in low-income to 86% in high-income countries. The study used self-reported data only, which may be subject to bias. Data from wearable devices were not used as they could not be compared to self-reported data from surveys.&lt;/p&gt;

Brazil had a decade with different mega-sport events, so we want to highlight how many Brazilian young people have been practicing sports throughout this period. Methods: This secular trend was attended by over 37,000 young people during January 2007 and December 2018. This data is part of a project aimed at mapping physical fitness, growth indicators and sports practice of young Brazilians. Data were described using descriptive statistics techniques. Results: The girls' sport practice was always smaller than boys, despite the decrease in the practice of the boys in 2012. We note a substantial upsurge in the years before the Olympic Games. Especially in Brazil, the years before Rio's Olympic Games happened the men's soccer world cup and men's confederations cup. In this year&acirc;Äôs we note a substantial upsurge in sports practice. However, soccer, futsal (boys) and volleyball (girls) are the most practiced sports. Implications: From these results, the strategies for promoting sports can be revaluated. Understanding which sports are the most and least practiced by children is a first step towards directing policies for the promotion and democratization of sports, regardless of the sport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past few decades, Nike has been a force to reckon with when it comes to the world of sport shoes, particularly on the basketball front. But the fame of these Nike shoes has been created by one of all time basket ball hall of fame stars Michael Jordan. Most of these Nike lebron shoes are created mainly for two purposes; one is use in athletics, while the second one is style and fashion. One of the latest designs available is a brand involving the popular USA basket ball known as lebron James. The Nike Lebron shoes have gained a lot of popularity from the NBA lovers. At a very tender age of 18, he had already signed up to play professional basket ball. Also Lebron James landed a multi million dollar deal with the sports shoe manufacturer Nike. The deal which is worth over 90 million dollars, is supposed to last for 7 years. This implies that Lebron James has to market the Nike shoes and other clothes design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Michael Jordan is among the famous personality that initially were involved in marketing of the Nike shoes, the amount of money that Michael signed for, is peanut compared to the deal that lebron himself signed. Lebron James is just young, and therefore he has a very bright future in the world of professional basket ball. There are various types of Nike shoes that lebron James has customized from the Nike cooperation. Nike Lebron 9 low, the shoe is posed to be among the top big hit in the market, as compared to the pervious version of the shoe. The design has already bagged some awards from the designers, and looking by the trend, the shoe is destined to make it big. Secondly Nike lebron 9 cool greys, this Lebron Nike shoe is also doing well to compete with other sneakers in the sneakers world, and is available on Nike different stores. Most of the Nike Lebron shoes are very expensive, since they are designers' shoes. Although this is the case, Nike Corporation has also come up with cheaper Lebron shoes that give the same comfort and style. They target the lower market end of people, who love the Nike Lebron shoes design but cannot be able to access the expensive ones. Nike Lebron shoes are currently the leading brand of shoes that are best selling among the basket ball faithful. With all these Lebron designs to choose from all your sports need are met. As long as lebron James continue his dominant in the world of basket ball more and more Nike shoes will be launched and named after him. As for the former most valuable player in the US basket ball &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pinterest.com/pin/437975132490564118/&quot;&gt;league&lt;/a&gt;, he is expected to continue earning more cash. Although the price of some of Nike lebron shoes had dropped in some states after his departure from Cleveland cavaliers, both of them are set to benefit more from this deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cycling holidays are the new touristic trend of Italy: many Italian and foreign tourists have ridden Northern Italy by bike this summer. In fact, Italy has registered an increasing of the number of tourists who prefer a sporting and active holiday in the mountains of Italy. Italy bike tours allow people to live a new kind of holiday to enjoy the beautiful landscapes of the country, discover interesting cultural places, an uncontaminated nature and to play sport at the same time. Looking at the numbers, between 2012 and 2013 Italy bike tours have been chosen by 31% of tourists in Italy (it was 23% in 2012) and cycling holidays are registering a bigger success than hiking, passed from 23% to 21% in the last 12 months. These data are confirmed by Active Sport Tours, an Italian tour operator dedicated to cycling holidays in Italy for Italian and foreign tourists. The tour operator has directed a study about the world of bike tours in Italy based on the data given by the most important Italian researches institutes, such Enit, Eurisko, Istat, and other local tourist organizations (APT offices). Why do tourists choose this kind of holiday?&lt;/p&gt;

These days, we also have an option to Buy Lehenga Online Shopping as well. Now from trends to some history about leheghas. History has noticed very little changes in presenting the lehengha choli. In fact, in modern times only a few designer can think of changing. At best they can do some modifications, rest as a whole concept of gharga choli or lehengha choli is still remains the same. Usually leheghas are ankle length long pleated with long skirts seized near the waist line. The skirt is Elegant, graceful and flares around the hearer. Mostly every traditional, Indian leheghas used to be a skirt with umberalled typed shape. These days, in the fashion world, however, there are assorted shapes and sizes of the lehengas, giving it a new reformed look to the ethnic dress. The different types of lehengas are, Fish-tail-lehengas, lehengas (Straight-cut), lehengas (Panelled), lehengas (Circular), lehengas (A line), Lehengas with full flair and so on. From the historical place of Gujarat and Gujarat ghagra choli remain the iconic. The genealogical women like cotton-fabrics, adorn with embroidery and some mirror work. Especially on the blouse parts have detailed Patch work and mirror-work on them and these attires look very vibrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere Israel, a renowned hub for tech and innovation, comes in at 11th, with a total of US$112.3 million. While North America leads the way, Asia is now a rising force in sports tech. Its average deal size is significantly higher than in North America, with US$100 million-plus deals for China&acirc;Äôs Hupu and India&acirc;Äôs CureFit helping to push Asia to number two in the global rankings. &acirc;ÄúWhat we have been observing is that China is committed and ready to invest heavily into its tech companies,&acirc;Äù explains Penkert. &acirc;ÄúThis is driven by some large investment funds with endless resources. In sports tech, that led to some huge deals and boosted the average ticket size in Asia to almost US$24 million over the last five years, more than the average ticket sizes of all other regions combined. &acirc;ÄúThis availability of financial resources is obviously a big advantage. Whether that gap will be closed further is hard to say. Among all Asian cities, Beijing and Shanghai come in at number two and number five respectively, while Bangalore, the home of fitness solutions provider CureFit, is something of a surprise entry in seventh.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;July 18 (Reuters) - Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton celebrated a record-extending and &quot;surreal&quot; 90th career pole position on Saturday after a dominant Mercedes one-two in Hungarian Grand Prix qualifying. Championship-leading team mate Valtteri Bottas will start alongside the Briton on Sunday, with the Mercedes-powered Racing Point cars of Canadian Lance Stroll and Mexican Sergio Perez third and fourth. Hamilton is favourite to triumph for the eighth time at the Hungaroring and equal a record for most wins at the same grand prix held by retired Ferrari great Michael Schumacher, who won eight times in France. The pole was his seventh in Hungary, equalling Schumacher's record for that race, and his Mercedes again looked to be in a class of its own after the team won the opening two rounds in Austria. Hamilton, who lapped with a track record time of one minute 13.447 seconds, 0.107 faster than Bottas. The six-times world champion said he had not realised immediately the significance of a pole that leaves him 22 ahead of Schumacher, the next best qualifier in the history of the sport. 35-year-old, who also has 25 more than his Brazilian boyhood idol Ayrton Senna managed in his F1 career.&lt;/p&gt;

So what &lt;em&gt;trends&lt;/em&gt; should we expect to see in 2019? Esports sponsorship has&lt;wbr&gt; ...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bottas hailed Hamilton for another great job but hoped to reverse the positions on Sunday. Perez was quicker than Stroll in final practice but the Canadian got the lap that mattered and looked forward to a strong race in the 'pink Mercedes', a controversial car very similar to last year's title-winning Mercedes and under protest by Renault. The Ferraris followed the two-by-two team trend, with Sebastian Vettel lining up fifth and Charles Leclerc qualifying sixth -- a positive after a tough afternoon in Austria last weekend where they collided in the Styrian Grand Prix. Red Bull's Max Verstappen, on pole last year, could only qualify seventh and ahead of the McLaren pair of Lando Norris -- third in the championship -- and Carlos Sainz. Verstappen, who felt something was &quot;clearly not working&quot; with his car. The session was held without spectators, as at the first two races in Austria, due to the COVID-19 pandemic but some fans still gathered at vantage points on surrounding slopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I spoke with Shen Bo, a cofounder of Gudong, the closest Chinese equivalent to Strava, he estimated that China now had at least 200 million runners. &acirc;ÄúAre you sure?&acirc;Äù I asked, incredulous. &acirc;ÄúMass participation in sport has skyrocketed these last few years in China,&acirc;Äù he said simply. That was the highest estimate I heard by far (others, like race organizers from Sanfo, the Chinese equivalent of REI, guessed about 20 million). Yu Lanjiang, the founder of Zuiku, China&acirc;Äôs most widely used race registration app, said there were more than 800 road races that he knew of in 2017, along with at least 450 trail traces. This year, he expects the total to climb to more than 1,500. Sanfo put the number even higher, at more than 2,000. There were rumblings about China trying to get on the Ultra Trail World Tour, and this past April 15th, more than 40 marathons were held on the same weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&acirc;ÄúThat&acirc;Äôs the weekend Chinese officials see as having the best weather,&acirc;Äù one runner explained to me. &acirc;ÄúPlus, they&acirc;Äôve heard that the Boston Marathon is that weekend, too, and that&acirc;Äôs the famous one everyone knows! When I first lived in Beijing, back in 2006, a Chinese running frenzy was hard to imagine. Jogging on the street drew stares, and most runners stuck to tracks. Historically, running was something to avoid once you could afford to-a form of manual labor for peasants that a new middle class wished to avoid. Or it was a Marxist vestage. In the 1950s, Mao encouraged mass participation in sports to develop a kind of nationalist, proletariat strength, but little was ever said about the sport&acirc;Äôs more individualist utilities. But in the late aughts, a few years after I arrived, norms began shifting. A spiritual void was growing-for community, meaning, individual goals, and new pastimes-left by China&acirc;Äôs abandonment of Maoist communism, which capitalism couldn&acirc;Äôt always fill. &acirc;ÄúWhen Mao died in 1976, belief in communism began to erode. Now, four decades on, his successors have found the absence of a belief system to be a problem,&acirc;Äù The Economist wrote last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&acirc;ÄúShorn of Dao and Mao, modern China has been left with a corrupt party state and a brutal, Wild West capitalism. In a recent poll 88 percent of people said they believed that there was a moral decay and a lack of trust in society. At first, Chinese began running because of its accessibility, as more middle class began exploring new recreations. But soon after, many stumbled onto the more social, communal aspects that filled those bigger holes-the identity and support that comes from belonging to a larger running tribe. &acirc;ÄúChinese people began to ask, &acirc;ÄòNow what? &acirc;Äô&acirc;Äù one race organizer told me, discussing the mood after the 2008 Olympics, when China achieved its nationalist fantasy of winning the gold medal count. In the Games&acirc;Äô aftermath, athletics became less centered around global bragging rights and more introspective, more individually focused. Chinese were setting goals for themselves, organizers told me, running for their own mental health, and less for abstract notions of national strength. As I dove deeper into the Chinese running phenomenon, I kept coming back to those social shifts, which often contradicted the popular image of Chinese authoritarianism.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Super Athletes Or Super Frauds?]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt='Art Market Trends' src='https://live.staticflickr.com/3395/3413680635_58941acc48_b.jpg' class=&quot;wp-post-image&quot; style='clear:both; float:left; padding:10px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px; max-width: 335px;'&gt;Over the past couple of years the misuse of performance-enhancing drugs in the world of sports has increased enormously and no one seems to have the answer for this unbalanced behaviour. So the question arises, what exactly are we doing wrong? Is there a reason an athlete would risk years, months, days, hours of hard work to lose everything in a matter of seconds? Just to mention some examples of where doping has touched base we can mention: bicycle racing, sprinting, track, baseball, and tennis. One of the most acknowledged cases being the recent Tour de France at which daily reporting of doping endangered the race as riders had to quit the competition despite their efforts to be part of such prestigious event. If we take a look back, we find the beginnings of the problem through the misuse of anabolic (muscle-building) steroids at the gyms, fact that was increasingly stimulated by the day-to-day social pressures and the demanding life styles of our times. All this gathered together makes us take further steps to become super people and for those in the sports world who need to satisfy their desires to exceed their natural limits and capabilities to become super athletes. IAAF has initiated against former triple Olympic Champion Marion Jones who recently admitted taking steroids before the 2000 Sydney Games. Jones, the World Road Running champion has returned her Olympic medals and further actions will be taken regarding money, questionings, and banning of the sport. Is it a new trend to win a medal and a year later returned it? Or are we heading down the slippery slope?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;clear:both; float:left; padding:10px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px; max-width: 335px;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8nzQRI1Rhxg/hqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Evolution of San Siro - &euml;èô&igrave;òÅ&igrave;ÉÅ&quot; /&gt;Those who are searching for any sort of trade they can set up with Wholesale world cup jerseys.

&lt;p&gt;Gender Equalization: Kiteboarding started out as a male dominated sport as so many other extreme sports have in the past. Until the advent of the Bow/SLE kites kiting was generally difficult to master. Recent kites and lesson techniques have made the kiting less muscle and more finesse. From my observations, women are not only taking more lessons but are also making there presence known on the water. 11. Kiteboarding Families: Father and son, husband and wife; brothers,sisters, mom's and dad's all taking lessons together, traveling together and moreover riding together. Simular to going on a snowboard or ski vacation, more families are making their plans around the windy spots. 10. Kite Kiddies: As with families, dad wants to see junior riding. As teaching techniques improve, more and more kids are making and appearance in the water. Safety, always a number one concern, kids equipment will be modified for their smaller frames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. Safety: Safety is the ever evolving process that keeps the sport more user friendly. Better quick releases, universal color coding, and kite depower modifications are leading the way to a safer operation. 8. Cost: The reality is, kites are cheap. Most manufactured in Asia, for pennies on the dollar. Kites are getting cheaper to manufacture, and that cost savings will be passed on the consumer. On the other hand, in the next couple of years there are going to be the release of the first super high-end kite. Made from super materials. 7. Materials: There will always be ripstop nylon. But, kites may follow the trends of sailboat and windsurfer sails. Mylar, cubin, aramid for the sails, and better spectra and dyneema for the lines. Board construction, runs the gamut from pvc all the way to snowboard style sandwich construction. On the other hand, few companies have jumped aboard the green wave that is beginning to take root in the surfing industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bamboo and hemp on one end and all recycled materials rounding it out. 6. Progression: In the past couple of years, a new generation of tricks have found there way to water. Gone are the days, of one footers and dead man's. Sliders, mega moves and multiple tricks are becoming common place due to combination of snowboard and wakeboarding. Surf style continues to gain ground and more spots are being kitesurfed. 5. Kiteboarding Space: On one hand, more and more kitespots are in jeopardy due to litigation, user competition and environmental impact. Yet, many more spots open up each year. Similarly, kiters are welcomed as an economic boost to many communities. In the future, some areas will be closed, while a new trend of more kiteboarding parks will arise (Real Kiteboarding)You'll pay for full amenities, patrol, lessons, exclusive features (sliders, kickers, etc.)Also, destination kiteboarding spots, like Tavarua in the surf world, are ready to be found. 4. Micro Forecasting; This the trend that most interests me. Anyone can open a computer, go to ten thousand different forecasts, weather reports, and make a decent prediction. My trend is a live daily report right from the beach. With, new cell technology, I am going to do a daily report telling you first hand how it is. 3. The Great Divide: This trend follows many different directions. Boots to wakestyle, strapless to strapped, twin-tip to mutant. Each of these are getting farther apart with more &quot;specialists&quot;. Yet, the generalist seems to have the most fun when they can do them all. 2. Mass Media: Kiteboarding is going to be in the X-games or some other extreme sports event soon. Kiteboarding is very spectator friendly and is a couple years away from being a media darling. 1. Olympics: Kiteboard racing will be in the 2016 Olympics! Most likely as a trial sport, there is a great chance this will come true. It is slowly gaining recognition from the sailing community and the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

Of course, this means that you should start prepping your nails for the world to see. A trip to the salon is just what you will need to take pleasure in an hour of nail pampering. Manicures and pedicures are a great way to keep your digits looking chic and polished, and everyone from students to doctors indulges in this experience. Even if you will be visiting the most immaculate salon in the area, it is best to not shave in order to avoid bacteria from entering the tiny cuts on your skin made by a razor. That's because bacteria can be present in water pipes and footbaths. In fact, the best time to visit the salon is in the morning, when the footbaths have just been thoroughly disinfected. If you really want to be certain of your safety, you can bring your own tub liner. Avoid the cuticle stick if you can.&lt;/p&gt;

This can also cause ingrown toenails. If your cuticles really bother you, you can have them gently pushed back with an orange cuticle stick, but make sure that the tip is wrapped in cotton. Don't make gel polish a frequent thing. Gel polish leaves your nails looking yummy and trendy and it does last much longer than regular nail polish. However, the treatment, from the UV curing process and the removal with the use of acetone to the filing away of the top layer of the nail, will do damage to your nails in the long run. So your best bet would be to sport this trend only on one extra special occasion for the summer. Professional salons always disinfect their tools, but if you are unsure you can always ask to have them disinfected with hydrogen peroxide right before they start with your treatment. You can also bring your own tools for the nail technician to use. Keep in mind that wood products such as orange sticks, buffers, and files are for a one-time use only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of the app is to enhance the game you&acirc;Äôre watching on the field, said Chad Evans, senior vice president, product development, mobile at MLB. &acirc;ÄúAR is going to bring new experiences to the fans, and baseball will be at the forefront,&acirc;Äù he added. For advertisers and broadcasters, there are benefits too. Technology has already been trialled to personalize TV viewers&acirc;Äô experience of football games, most notably in 2018 when the FA and ITV ran a test during the England v Costa Rica friendly. Dynamic perimeter ads around the pitch were streamed to audiences based on location using Virtual Replacement Technology, allowing different viewers to see different ads. The ad offering was split into two feeds: one to the Americas, and the other to Asia, Australasia and parts of Europe. It is important that sports teams and athletes recognize the continued importance of social channels in building their fanbases and capitalizing on brand opportunities. Social channels like Instagram and Twitter present spaces where fan communities can be cultivated and maintained. This prime advertising space can also be used to present a humanized version of athletes and round-the-clock access to the sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instagram stories and livestreams let athletes and teams give their followers what appears to be exclusive, behind-the-scenes style insights on training sessions and offer the opportunity to host impromptu Q&amp;As to bring fans closer to their idols. Often these sessions are brand-sponsored. The North Face clothing brand is a prime example of how social sponsorship deals with athletes can help to promote its own products, while also supporting the work of the sports star. Prior to the release of the Oscar-winning &acirc;ÄòFree Solo&acirc;Äô documentary, The North Face Instagram page featured stories and content promoting the film and extreme rock climber Alex Honnold. These stories gave viewers exclusive insights on where they could watch the movie and insider information on the athlete. Much of The North Face social content is produced with the aim of supporting outdoor athletes, with its social content putting the experiences of the experts at the heart of the brand&acirc;Äôs campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-H6X5KUSkfg?rel=0&amp;playsinline=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;color=white&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen title=&quot;13 Times the Impossible Became Possible...&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motor Trend magazine, one of the world's premiere automotive publications has included the new Mercedes-Benz GL 450 on their long term test fleet. The GL 450, the first and only model (as of today) on the Mercedes-Benz GL-Class full size luxury crossover sport utility vehicle (SUV) segment made its debut at the 2006 North American International Auto Show when the German automaker finally decided to include an entry in the full size luxury crossover SUV market. Motor Trend has also named the Mercedes-Benz GL 450 as the 2007 Sport/Utility of the Year. The Mercedes-Benz GL 450 is powered by a monstrous 4.6-liter DOHC 32-valve V8 front engine that pumps out 335-hp and delivers 339-lb-ft amount of peak torque, combined with a 7-speed automatic transmission powering the Mercedes' 4Matic all-wheel drive configuration with traction control. The GL 450 also comes with adjustable-ride air suspension, Mercedes CV boot, as well as 18-inch wheels and performance tires for the vehicle to ride on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard interior highlights include heated and powered front seats, bird's eye maple trim, manual 60/40-split second-row and powered 50/50-split third-row seating, multifunction steering wheel with mounted controls, eight-speaker premium audio system. The Mercedes-Benz GL 450 won't compromise the safety of its occupants. The vehicle is equipped with advanced safety equipments including eight standard airbags (including two front airbags for the driver and passenger, side airbags for the first and second rows and three-row head-protection curtain air bags), seatbelt pretensioners as well as passive safety systems like electronic hill-descent control, anti lock braking system (ABS), roll stability controls (RSC) with traction control. Meanwhile, bunch of premium packages for the Mercedes-Benz are also offered. These include the premium package that includes Parktronic, power tailgate, DVD navigation system, Sirius Satellite Radio, premium sound with rear controls, power tilt/telescoping steering, and BlueTooth hands-free mobile phone, and rear-seat DVD entertainment system. The off-road package comes with adaptive damping, two locking differentials, and front/rear skid plates to provide all-terrain capability and better traction. Other optional features include twin sunroofs three-zone climate-control, Macadamia leather interior trim, rearview backup camera, wood and leather steering wheel, and Bi-Xenon headlamps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the amount of physical activity children get in and out of school has declined in recent years, youngsters have become more overweight and less fit. To help reverse that trend, some fitness experts say, physical education classes should be revamped so there is less emphasis on team sports and more on lifelong fitness activities. Included: Descriptions of physical education programs that stress fitness, health awareness, and lifelong exercise habits. Practical, proven lesson plans and resources written and submitted by real teachers and approved by the PE Central expert editorial team! The words dodge ball still can cause some adults to shudder, even though it might have been decades since a ball beaned them in a physical education class. Though some adults thrived on the competition in their school physical education classes, others remember the experience as humiliating, with the operative word being last -- picked last for a team or coming in last in the mile run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For too long, some fitness experts say, physical education has not lived up to its name: Traditional phys-ed classes provide too little activity to too few students, offer little or no guidance for maintaining a healthful lifestyle, and can make less athletic children feel inadequate, which can further turn them off to exercise. Enter a new generation of phys ed, with programs that stress lifelong fitness activities, such as walking, biking, in-line skating, and tennis; educate students about healthful diets; and teach students how to monitor their heart rates and pulses. To accommodate those new programs, some school districts have renovated their gymnasiums to look like fitness centers and revamped their curriculums to emphasize fitness over competition. Several national organizations also are promoting changes to phys-ed curriculums and working with school systems that want to offer new activities. Phys-ed curriculum changes have been prompted in part by reports that the nation's children weigh more and are less active than ever before. And with many school systems sacrificing phys-ed time to squeeze in more classroom time, students are getting even less exercise. Some health experts say that needs to change.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Mercedes Only Willing To Give Hamilton Half Of His &Acirc;&pound;40m Salary Demands]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FkrsPeMBcgk?modestbranding=1&amp;controls=1&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen title=&quot;9 months ago (c) by N/A&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lewis Hamilton's future in Formula One is suddenly in doubt with Mercedes boss Toto Wolff set to offer him half the salary he is demanding. As Sportsmail reported on Thursday, the six-time world champion is asking for &Acirc;&pound;40million a year to stay at Mercedes beyond his current deal, which expires at the end of the season. But Wolff will not countenance any such figure. Can ANYONE stop Lewis Hamilton? Mercedes will tell their star driver that the world situation has changed since coronavirus struck. The pandemic has brought about a strict budget cap for next year of &Acirc;&pound;130m, with further reductions due to be introduced over the coming seasons. That means hundreds of job cuts in the industry, a backdrop that makes Hamilton's demands for an increase on his existing &Acirc;&pound;36m salary seem outlandish. Mercedes, who employ 1,000 staff on their F1 programme in Northamptonshire, will have to trim or redeploy 300 of the workforce. Wolff's direction of travel was made clear in recent discussions over the budget cap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be revealed that he argued for a $25m (&Acirc;&pound;20m) limit on driver salaries, which are so far exempt from any restriction. Hamilton, 35, believes his record as an 84-time race winner entitles him to great riches, even though that would be bucking a trend towards diminishing salaries across the sport. Even Ferrari decided to release Sebastian Vettel - the only driver on a similar pay grade to Hamilton - after Covid-19 struck. They signed Carlos Sainz from McLaren to partner Charles Leclerc instead, a far from lavish line-up for the grid's traditional biggest spenders. If Wolff holds firm, Hamilton must decide whether to accept a major pay cut or move on, either to retirement or, if a seat were available, to a new team. Wolff talked on Friday of there being 'no urgency' in negotiations with the Briton, saying they would 'take the next steps soon'. But sources close to Wolff say he believes Hamilton has limited bargaining power, his options elsewhere being closed. He is keeping Vettel, the four-time world champion, in the picture as a possible replacement. Wolff said: 'I like Sebastian a lot. He's my neighbour in Switzerland. He's one of the great drivers in F1. Can ANYONE stop Lewis Hamilton?&lt;/p&gt;

For all the dedication, diligence and hard work put in by all the members in a team, Awards come out as a grand reward to recognize the success of the winning team. The ancient form of man-made reward was in the shape of cups. In olden times the trophy cup was also known as a loving cup as the people in the church used to express a sense of community by passing around this &quot;loving cup&quot; from one person to another. Such shape of the Awards and cups are still presented in present day's sport functions. The success of every sport is displayed by means of presentation of Awards and medals. There are several different types of sports Awards manufactured by trophy manufacturing company such as football trophies, rugby trophies, cricket trophies, tennis trophies, basketball trophies, badminton trophies, hockey trophies and many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downfall of Dean Laidley is just the latest in a string of tragedies to rock the AFL's coaching fraternity, with one legend claiming the trend has hit 'disturbing' levels. Laidley, 53, was arrested on Saturday and charged with stalking, but it was images of him wearing a blonde wig and women's clothing during his police interview that took the community by shock. Those close to the former North Melbourne coach reportedly had growing 'concerns' over his behaviour in the lead up to his arrest, with his drug use allegedly getting 'out of control'. But while many in the football industry appear to those on the outside to have it all, a legend of the game has pointed out the cut throat environment of elite coaching can take a serious toll. Laidley's time behind bars continues a trend of big names losing their way off-field in recent years, including Danny Frawley, James Hird and Mark 'Bomber' Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[The State Of Media &amp; Entertainment Streaming 2020]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;In the last year, North American pay-TV and subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) markets continued to move in opposite directions, to the point where the number of households with SVOD services has reached near parity with those that subscribe to pay-TV services. In a biennial study conducted by Leichtman Research Group (LRG) in 2019, nearly three-quarters of U.S. SVOD service, up from 64% in 2017. That jibes with a Parks Associates research report that found that nearly three-quarters of U.S. Another report, Broadcast Intelligence's &quot;Pay TV's Future in an On-Demand World: U.S. Market Edition,&quot; says that the largest drop in pay-TV subscriptions in a decade occurred in 2019. It predicts further decline after the loss of 18 million subscribers in 8 years. DirecTV is estimated to have lost 14% of its subscribers (around 2.7 million) in Q4 2019, while Comcast lost 700,000 (3%) of its subscribers over the course of the year. The pay-TV decline is set to accelerate by 20% between now and 2023 as consumers are encouraged by increasingly reliable high-speed broadband coverage to switch to streaming services. The number of homes with broadband subscriptions is on the rise: The biggest U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center; clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FkrsPeMBcgk?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;color=white&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen title=&quot;9 months ago (c) by N/A&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;605,000 net broadband subscribers in Q3 2019, surpassing 100 million subscribers for the first time, according to LRG. However, cord-cutting continues. LRG says that the biggest pay-TV providers lost about 1.74 million net subscribers in Q3 2019. Analytics company GlobalData estimates that there were 147 million subscribers to SVODs throughout North America by the end of last year-more than 90% of them from the U.S. Broadcast Intelligence analyst Jack Genovese. With the majority of Americans (59%) already unwilling to pay more than $20 a month for streaming TV services, according to a recent survey by ad-tech firm The Trade Desk, there are warnings of subscription fatigue. Brian Stempeck, chief strategy officer at The Trade Desk. Content providers are under pressure to produce new premium content that drives membership and viewership, even as more brands dive into the market. 2019, Parks Associates' top 10 SVOD services list showed gains for CBS All Access and Sling TV. Brett Sappington, senior research director and principal analyst at Parks Associates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;November 2019 and costs $4.99 per month for access to a variety of original TV shows and movies. Apple bundled a free year of the service with the purchase of a new product such as an iPhone or iPad. 9 billion-a-year business by 2025, even with conservative sign-up estimates. Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty. Not everyone is convinced. 31 million downloads from the Apple App Store and Google Play in Q4 2019, more than double second-place TikTok, and has been downloaded nearly 41 million times across the Apple App Store and Google Play as of this writing. In the Apple App Store, it bumped YouTube from the No. 1 position for the first time in a year. Q4 2019, capturing 34% of total U.S. Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video. So far, it has amassed nearly $100 million in user spending. Netflix but rather a complementary service. NBCUniversal will launch its ad-supported Peacock service in April 2020 with subscription tiers. Peacock Free will offer more than 7,500 hours of programming, including the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Spanish-language content, and curated Peacock streaming genre channels such as SNL Vault and Family Movie Night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peacock Premium will be free to 24 million Comcast and Cox subscribers and will include tent-pole series and additional sports, such as the English Premier League, beginning in August 2020, and the Ryder Cup, beginning in September 2020. Customers can pay to upgrade for an ad-free experience (from $5 to $9.99 a month). AT&amp;T's WarnerMedia will launch HBO Max in May 2020 with 10,000 hours of content, including every episode of Friends and a $250 million production deal with J.J. Abrams, as part of a $1-$2 billion content outlay. At launch, HBO Max will be free for customers who are already subscribed to HBO and $14.99 a month for new subscribers. AT&amp;T customers with some newer unlimited plans will also gain free access to HBO Max. Although Netflix boasted more than 61 million customers in the U.S. 2019, making it still the dominant streaming service, its domestic growth is slowing and is expected to top out at 90 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of the U.S., Netflix's growth is on fire. It added 8.33 million subscribers in Q4 2019, exceeding a predicted 7 million, and now has 167.1 million global subscriptions. About 90% of Netflix's new business comes from outside of the U.S. The streamer's refusal to allow advertising on its platform is a calculated risk, since it must generate cash to fund original content. According to Laura Martin, a media analyst at Needham, it could lose 4 million U.S. 2020 if it doesn't introduce a lower-priced ad-supported tier to compete with less-expensive rival services. Paolo Pescatore, tech, media, and telco analyst at PP Foresight. Netflix spent about $15 billion on content in 2019, with BMO Capital Markets thinking this will increase to more than $17 billion in 2020, even while it has more than $14 billion in long-term debt to bondholders and third-party content producers, according to Variety. Pescatore expects Netflix to increase subscription fees in all key markets during 2020. He says that despite intensifying competition in the U.S. Netflix &quot;remains in pole position&quot; and should be able to ride out the storm in the short-term.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Honda CBR 500 Review - Motorcycles]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Everyone is aggressive to know about the latest trend in bikes in India. Honda CBR 500 was the most awaited bike. It has been launched in our country on 2nd Dec 2012 at the price of 3,75,000/- Rupees. It is a series of Honda sport bikes. Honda is always known for its speed, energy and amazing looks. They are one of the popular two-wheeler industries in India. It was founded by a Japanese native Soichiro Honda in 1946. Mogul D was the first bike developed by them in 1949 and today the market is full of amazing latest bikes in India. They have grasp a position of power attached by esteem in the market and has become a book mark in the dictionary of two-wheeler industries. Their Motorcycles Company is holding the position of world largest manufacturer of motorbikes.

It is expected to become a huge hit in the market, because it is equipped with amazing features, so keep your eyes on it. It will be produced in Thailand. If they manufactures CBR 500 in India than they will be able to get a huge price advantage over its competitors. The Honda CBR 500 will be powered by a 500cc, twin-cylinder engine, which is essentially two CBR 250 R engines arranged in parallel format. It will produce 46 BHP of power and 40 Nm of torque. Hp, I think it should make even more HP. HP and it's still on the light side, only a little over the regular 250 Ninja, with a bigger gas tank. 25HP to 50 isn't a big deal, it's been done better with the old 57. HP CB500 made from 1994-2003, why go backwards, they could still restrict it to whatever it needs to be. If they would make it with &lt;A Href=&quot;https://nusadaily.com/fashion/fenomena-tren-sportswear-yang-kian-berkembang.html&quot;&gt;65HP,&lt;/A&gt; or so HP, I would buy it in a heartbeat. Well this is my view for this bike.&lt;/p&gt;

Postponements and cancellations began raining down across sports leagues far and wide, ranging from the NCAA Tournament to the start of baseball season. For sports fans, the sense of normalcy was driven out the door, leaving many to question what was next. Will there be an NBA or NHL playoffs? Will outdoor sports like baseball and golf return without fans? How is this all going to work? As the nation -- and the globe -- were gripped by the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, NASCAR was one of the sports holding out in hopes of continuing 2020 as planned. It has the benefit of being a non-contact sport (person-to-person, that is) and the advantages of open-air working in its favor. Still, the risk of spreading the virus was far too high, so NASCAR followed suit and put the season on hold as tracks closed following stay-at-home orders around the country.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[All You Need To Know About The Bullfighting In Spain - Destination Tips]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;It's a traditional spectacle. In this traditional event, one or more bulls are fought in a bullring. Within the areas where it is practiced, it can be defined as a blood sport, it is not considered a sport but as a cultural event and art form. It is very popular in Spain among the other Spanish fest and festivals. Bullfighting is seen as a symbol of Spanish culture and tradition, you may criticize it but Spanish believe in them. Some people ask, is bullfighting legal in Spain? Not really in some parts of Spain it is completely banned. It has influenced all forms of art and culture. Spanish dance and musical forms such as the paso doble and flamenco are heavily influenced by the spectacle of the bullfight. Bullfighting history in Spain started in 711 A.D. King Alfonso VIII. It is also called 'corrida de Toros' in the Spanish language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Spain was part of the Roman Empire, bullfighting tradition introduces as an adventure sport. In starting bullfighting was reserved for Spanish aristocracy and was held on horseback, but King Felipe V believed it was in poor taste for nobles to practice such a bloody sport and he ended this trend. Commoners keep on develop bullfighting on foot with smaller weapons. The oldest bullring in Spain is located in the southern town of Ronda, but cities like Madrid, Seville, and Pamplona also have a rich bullfighting legacy and some of the largest rings in the world. A bullfight is an event in which the bullfighters, on foot or on horseback, confront a number of the bull in an enclosed space built for this purpose. Bullfighting in Spain Madrid is so popular than others. Now the questions arise that were to see bullfighting in Spain? First, buy tickets. The best way of buying your bullfight tickets is simply to head to the Bullring itself, which usually starts selling them about ten days before the event. The tickets is quite easy to buy before 10 days of the event. Prices range from E10 ($12) at the top in the sun to over E100 ($123) for shaded front-row seats. Tickets are also available online from some of the bullrings websites. For Spanish, it is not a sport, it is a cultural event. The person who really executes the bull is known as a bullfighter and every bullfighter has six associates. Estacada is called the process of killing the bull. A most interesting fact about the bullfighting is the bulls are specifically bred for bullfighting. The bull's life can sometimes be spared. The biggest Spanish bullring is in Madrid. Spain has bullfighting schools for children. It is banned in some areas of Spain. It is banned but not in the whole of Spain. There have been female matadors for more than 100 years. It appears to be intriguing about bullfighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&acirc;Äôs a perception that betrays a harmless ignorance at best, a colonial superiority and even racism at worst. Toropov, once enrolled in a Soviet Union academy himself before moving to the U.K., admired runners like Qi Min. After the system they&acirc;Äôd survived, he believed, their success shouldn&acirc;Äôt come as a surprise to anyone. If you don&acirc;Äôt have pleasure when you train, you will never improve. It was hard to imagine a more dramatic change in lifestyle than the one Qi Min had undergone. He and Yao Miao now lived in Dali, one of China&acirc;Äôs most beautiful cities and a base for adventure tourism, on the edge of the Tibetan plateau in Yunnan. He was roommates with his best friend and training partner, Shen Jiasheng, another escapee from the state academies and a favorite for the 125K race at Gaoligong. The two of them frequently posted photos on WeChat-a Chinese social media platform that combines Facebook-like aspects with text messaging-of their running adventures in the mountains. The posts were popular, selling running as a carefree lifestyle. The two were rooming together at Gaoligong, as they did at many races.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed watching Qi Min interact with fans in the days leading up to the race, stationed beneath Garmin&acirc;Äôs tent at the Gaoligong start. He was patient with the endless requests for pictures, and many of his admirers were running in the race. Athletes who went through China&acirc;Äôs state training academies tended to be shy; Shen Jiasheng, for one, spoke in a more reserved tone, but Qi Min cracked sarcastic jokes and smiled widely for photos. When I asked him whether all the attention, especially from girls, ever annoyed him, he almost interrupted me. &acirc;ÄúNot at all,&acirc;Äù he said. &acirc;ÄúOf course I love it! Naturally outgoing, Qi Min wanted to branch out even more. In the fall he was hoping to study English, which he never learned in the training academies, to interact with more foreign athletes and outgrow what he admitted had been a poor education. Toropov noted that Qi Min always avoided speaking in his local Yunnan dialect, even when around friends like Shen Jiasheng-a sort of pledge to himself to avoid sounding less-educated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;img class='wp-post-image' alt=&quot;THE CHAMPIONSHIP Road to MotoGP&acirc;Ñ&cent; - &euml;èô&igrave;òÅ&igrave;ÉÅ&quot; src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E_9GZZai0Hg/hqdefault.jpg&quot; style='max-width: 320px;'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;There were practical reasons, too, of course, for learning English: At one race in Hong Kong, he&acirc;Äôd taken a wrong turn after misreading a sign in English, costing him an extra 12 kilometers. When I asked him whether he&acirc;Äôd like to see the sports system changed in China, he gave a devious grin. &acirc;ÄúWell, you know, in China, you shouldn&acirc;Äôt run your mouth too much,&acirc;Äù he said. &acirc;ÄúBut I hope it becomes a more open system eventually. I just hope that you won&acirc;Äôt have kids forced to do things they don&acirc;Äôt want to do.&acirc;Äù What he admired most about the top athletes in trail running around the world was that they were mostly obsessed hobbyists. In China, passion wasn&acirc;Äôt a required prerequisite for the development of a promising athlete. One day, he hoped it would be. When I spoke with Shen Jiasheng, a few days later, he agreed. He&acirc;Äôd been out of the system for more than a year now, but he was already frequently posting pictures of his free-range life in Dali. On WeChat, Qi Min and Shen Jiasheng were making up for time lost to the academies and provincial teams.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[What Can You Store At A Storage Depot?]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;There is no dearth of items and objects to be found in a person&acirc;Äôs house. In the earlier days, people desired little and had big homes. Now-a-days, we hoard a lot of things in our homes and wonder why we are falling short of space. This trend will continue as shopping is literally at our fingertips and e-commerce deliveries are at the most 48-hours away -- bringing a paradigm of how people shop. If that was not enough, the rise of social media advertising and daily deals have people hooked on. The result -- homes bursting at its seams. Herein comes to the rescue the world of storage. Electronic items such as computers, laptops, music systems, printers etc. are affected readily by the changing weather one has to be careful that one doesn&acirc;Äôt store them in too humid a place. If the place of storage is too hot, it may damage the internal sensitive components of the electronic items. For book lovers, stashing away books in corner pieces, or drawers or in a cabinet generally takes up a lot of space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people after reading a book do not use or refer to it until years later. Another thing is that generally, book lovers do not want to give up on their &acirc;Äòfavourite companions&acirc;Äô. This makes book occupy a lot of space in a home. This is where a storage unit comes in handy. We become enthusiastic about a sport. Buy the entire sporting apparatus, and a few days later this equipment are shifted to the corner of a house or in the garage; occupying a lot of place. Even gardening equipment that which is not used on a regular basis typically uses up space that could be freed up for other useful matter. These things can conveniently be stored in a storage centre with a small fee. This takes up an ample amount of area in almost every property -- be it residential or commercial. Furniture, no wonder, is also the top stored item in storage properties. But due care has to be taken while storing in any of the storage units near you, as it is made up to wood and/or cloth and if exposed to humidity, risks being attacked by mildew. Furthermore, it is advisable to keep the furniture while storing at an elevated position to secure proper ventilation and that the air flows freely to its every corner.

&lt;p&gt;Li Zhaohui continued to monologue from the finish line. At one point, he embarked on a tangent about China&acirc;Äôs Hundred Years of Shame at the hands of foreign powers, beginning with the first Opium War in 1839, and ending with Japanese occupation in World War II. Such running events, he implored, would surely make China a stronger nation. But the appeal to nationalism felt somewhat at odds with the actual runners, who, when I spoke with many of them, had more personal reasons for running. &acirc;ÄúIt&acirc;Äôs just something I started doing for fun with friends,&acirc;Äù a 50-year-old finisher, who had only begun running three years earlier, told me. The next morning, all indications pointed to a successful event. At the hotel, Toropov was scrolling through the photos racers had shared on social media. Responses from the nearly 3,000 runners were positive overall. Li Zhaohui had lost his voice. I flew to Beijing the following day, hoping to track down running groups in the city where the boom began, and talk with more organizers about the explosion of races.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/iapyhvAOGaw?rel=0' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen title='THOMAS SABO - KITESURFING, A'&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I couldn&acirc;Äôt imagine how they could be commercially sustainable, nor as lavish as Gaoligong, and I wondered about a bubble. In recent years, China had had plenty of them-from stock market drops to bike-share graveyards to the overbuilding of apartment complexes. Wei Jun confirmed my suspicions. He saw cultural ticks fueling the boom, particularly when it came to China&acirc;Äôs penchant for copycatting and rushing headlong into a nascent market. In his office in Beijing, he pointed to the iPhone sitting on his desk. &acirc;ÄúIn China, as soon as people see a friend buying something, they want it, too,&acirc;Äù he explained. &acirc;ÄúThe officials are like that when they see a rival county holding a race now. They want to have one as well. And then an entrepreneur sees all these race organizers forming, and they want to try, too! In China, grassroots fads and government embrace often snowball on top of one another, and running appeared to be on the same path. Races play into the political incentives of local Chinese officials, whom the governing party rotates around the country in two-year shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For cadres up for promotion, the best CVs highlight rapid economic growth, along with other miscellaneous accomplishments in producing civic events and &acirc;Äúcultural services&acirc;Äù with large mass participation. Hosting races checks almost every box for resume building. Media coverage of the races provides exposure for their city, however remote or unremarkable, and luring sponsors and TV coverage gives officials a chance to showcase alleged economic growth. And since they&acirc;Äôre required to spend all the money they&acirc;Äôre allocated for such events annually, there&acirc;Äôs no incentive to hold back, nor consider-since they&acirc;Äôll be gone in two years-what activities might generate long-term growth. Asking whether such investments make economic sense misses the point; for Chinese officials, it&acirc;Äôs not really about commercial viability. Such a system, however, isn&acirc;Äôt lucrative. &acirc;ÄúYou ask anyone and they&acirc;Äôll tell you,&acirc;Äù Toropov told me, &acirc;Äúno one is making money from races in China.&acirc;Äù Yu Lanjiang agreed. He assumed the number of runners in China would grow for a few more years but wasn&acirc;Äôt sure about the sustainability of the commercial growth around them.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Reasons Why Golf Course Investment Properties Are Booming - Real Estate]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;img style='max-width: 380px;' src=&quot;https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7c/cf/0f/7ccf0f2a11f023c54ee187ac111f0e07.png&quot; class=&quot;wp-post-image&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;North India has some of the most engaging golf courses in the world, surrounded by greenery and beautiful views of forests and lakes. In this one-spot crazy country, golf is making its way back to lead India. The emerging trend of playing golf has introduced a sense of positivity among the real estate sector, encouraging golf course investment as a fruitful one. There are more reasons justifying golf residences as one of the crucial investments, among others. Well, golf enthusiasts would love to spend on such villas and homes not only due to their passion but also it has a peaceful lifestyle. Thus, investing in golf course property is a wise decision, clearly defined by these following five primary reasons. Buying into a residential golf estate is a smart stroke of strategy if thought from an investment point of view. Proximity to a golf course is a factor that can importantly boost residential values- just like views, elevation, and waterfront setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flawless design and master planning behind these estates generally exhibit them a strong long-term investment proposition. If a buyer thinks of resale value, it is excellent because most golf residences have amazing views, atmosphere, and amenities that allegedly claim to provide a great price. You are wrong if you think that life in golf residences is an unobtainable luxury. The rates of real estate properties are only slightly higher than similar homes in neighboring suburbs as they hold the promise of a much happier, healthier lifestyle. Thus, homebuyers who have settled at the golf estate seem so glad to pay a small premium to reside in tranquility. This premium is the price of knowing that their quality of life will outstrip that of their neighbors. In simple words: it's money well spent! So, a smart investment leads to a secure future. Money matters aside; the significant reason that more people are opting into golf residences in India is simply the lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Internet Sports Betting Information - Gambling]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;There are various reasons to go for Internet sport betting besides the convenience of home. If you are already into Internet sport betting then you must be already aware how the World Wide Web is loaded with free sports picks, Sports Betting Advice, Internet sport betting discounts and so much more. Many people are into Internet sport betting because of the easy money it offers. But you must always remember the risk factor. It is a good idea to understand the various Sports Betting System and its pros and cons too. You must follow a thorough research process before you place your bets. Never let your emotions rule you. To win you need to be a little strategic and think from the practical view point. Accept the fact that your favorite team cannot win all the time. Betting on your favorite team each time is not a mature Internet sport betting decision. There are many websites that provide Sports Betting Services but you should make it certa&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.maddyness.com/uk/2020/02/27/purpose-driven-sport-the-10-global-trends-we-will-see-2020/&quot;&gt;in&lt;/a&gt; that you are playing with a top online sports book. It is a good option if you get professional Sports Handicapping Service to be more successful in online sports betting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;clear:both; float:left; padding:10px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px; max-width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;https://media3.cgtrader.com/variants/5RfptBogmgAVwhkLV4jnJ7KT/9cae6891d5963582c5a024dd4cd2d77f44d540a2ca4f778b8c6afa6918049521/cartoon-city-block-fashion-store-3d-model-low-poly-max-obj-fbx-c4d-ma-mb-blend.jpg&quot; class='wp-post-image'&gt;Choose a team for which you have enough strong points. Do not choose a team just because you like it or you want to see it lose. It is good if you bet on your home team. But this requires you to be rational. You will get extensive information about your home team from different media. It is advisable that you do internet sports betting on a limited number of games. As online sports betting require concentration, too many games will create a mess. The best possible number depends on the experience of the person who is wagering. Do not do guess work if you do not have enough information about the game you are betting on. Guessing is an example of poor Sports Handicapping. Try to spot out trends in sports betting. Your trend analysis can help you a lot. For example there are teams which most of times beat some other teams. Try to collect these types of trends. Try to evaluate the team performance on a regular basis. This is because a team which was a winner last week may not be a winner this week. So always consider performance factor while choosing a team. Gather as much statistical information as you can. This will surely help you while Sports Handicapping. Also read about Internet sports betting rules and regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the year ends, we might see the dawn of another trend on digital devices as Google is set to launch Goggles, basically an eyewear with smartphone capability. The lenses will serve as a monitor where you can view information, entertainment and advertisements wherever you are. It focuses on the projection of an information layer over physical objects that you see or what is called augmented reality. Though no one has confirmed seeing the Google glasses firsthand, rumors continue flying as Norton Scientific Journal reported in detail about the product. This might be because it is being developed in the uber secretive offices of Google X, a laboratory near Google's main campus where engineers/scientists are working on other projects. Goggles will reportedly use the same Android OS that powers tablets and smartphones, equipping the glasses with motion sensors and GPS. The eyeglasses will also sport audio I/O and camera. Via the built-in camera on the eyeglasses, Google can stream and overlay information to the wearer.&lt;/p&gt;

And if ever facial recognition software is approved to be used in such a scale, the glasses could also enable the wearer to read details about the person he is looking at. On a more plausible and fun side, Goggles can be used for virtual reality games with the real world as playground. As expected, Google will integrate its other services to the glasses such as Google Latitude and Google Maps, which would be a huge help especially if you want to know how far you are from your destination, what the weather is like and other local details. Though Google Goggles is said to have more focus on objects than people, an advocacy group for web privacy has requested FTC to suspend the use of facial recognition programs. Electronic Privacy Information Center suggested that until the government has figured out proper privacy standards to protect users, such products should not be made available.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Here's How Much Kids Need To Move, Play And Sleep In Their Early Years]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;South Africa has just launched 24-hour movement guidelines for children from birth to five years, integrating physical activity, sitting behaviour, screen time and sleep. These guidelines intend to answer these and other questions, providing guidance that can help put young children on the best trajectory for their growth, health and development. The country is following the example of others that have recently updated or are busy updating their movement behaviour guidelines for the early years - Canada, Australia, and the UK. It's the first low- and middle-income country to bring out movement behaviour guidelines for this or any age group. These developments represent a shift towards integrated guidelines for children's physical activity, sitting and sleep behaviours. These guidelines take into account the natural and instinctual integration of these behaviours across a 24-hour period, and are intended to provide a more cohesive message for parents, caregivers, teachers and practitioners. Research shows that children from birth to five years who receive support to meet these movement guidelines are likely to grow up healthier, fitter and stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They may also have greater motor skill abilities, be more prepared for school, manage their feelings better, and enjoy life more. The development of the guidelines was supported by the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation South Africa which brought together a panel of stakeholders, practitioners and academics (local and international) from the field of early childhood. The panel considered the best available scientific evidence, the South African context and how the guidelines would be received across the country's very diverse settings. The guidelines recommend that children from birth to five years should participate in a range of play-based and structured physical activities that are appropriate for their age and ability, and that are fun and safe. Children should be encouraged to do these activities independently as well as with adults and other children. For caregivers, activities that are loving and involve play and talking with children are best. These guidelines also emphasise that the quality of what is done when sitting matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style='clear:both; float:left; padding:10px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px; max-width: 310px;' alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media2.cgtrader.com/variants/jxPdmpmdqYiGyaw1hEwE1uyN/9cae6891d5963582c5a024dd4cd2d77f44d540a2ca4f778b8c6afa6918049521/ditre-italia-eclectico-3d-model-max-fbx.jpg&quot; class='wp-post-image' /&gt;For children younger than two years, screen time is not recommended. Sitting activities that are screen-based should be limited among children aged two to five years. The quality of sleep in children from birth to five years is also important, and screen time should be avoided before bed. While the educational benefits of screen time receive much attention in the media, there's little scientific evidence to support the claims of these benefits. And the long-term, potentially negative, impacts of replacing &quot;traditional&quot; games and books with screen-based versions are not yet known. The World Cancer Research Fund recently highlighted the link between childhood screen time to 12 deadly cancers and short-sightedness. There is also a trend emerging among technologists in Silicon Valley to keep their children away from screens. This should surely be causing us to think twice about the easy role that screens play in little ones' lives. Early childhood represents &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kobe-bryant-was-a-girl-dad-and-now-the-sports-world-is-honoring-him-with-a-social-media-movement/&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; key window of opportunity to lay down a healthy foundation for children's movement behaviours, setting them up for a win as far as their growth, health and development are concerned. The guidelines can help build this foundation and can be used by anyone who has an interest in the health and development of all children from birth to five years - parents and family, educators, caregivers, health professionals, and community workers.

&lt;p&gt;The future of TV looks a lot like the TV of the past: ad-supported, premium content. Many analysts predict that 2020 will be the year of ad-supported video on demand (AVOD), as free ad models start to build scale and roll out internationally. Sarah Henschel, senior research analyst for media at IHS Markit Technology. YouTube shifted YouTube Originals from its premium subscription tier to its wider, free service in late 2018, and 2019 saw the launch of IMDb Freedrive from Amazon. In a 2019 interview, Tariq Mahmoud, who was, at the time, head of Roku's international sales and strategy, said that the Roku Channel is the fastest-growing channel in the platform's history. The latest Hisense TVs will have Tubi preloaded and placed on their home screens, and Tubi is also expanding internationally into Mexico (with TV Azteca) and the U.K. In January 2019, Viacom paid $340 million for Los Angeles-based AVOD service Pluto TV. This included 12 million active monthly AVOD users and distribution on more than 30 million devices across the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[4 Jewelry Trends For This Season]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;So what's the latest trend in the jewelry industry? What are the most sought after jewelry designs at the moment? Read on to stay up-to-date. While it is usually easier to choose an outfit, choosing the right jewelry could actually be a challenge. You are ready for that party and step before the mirror to have a last look at yourself. You're happy with what you see - your makeup highlights your features; your eyebrows are properly trimmed; your stilettos complement your dress. But something isn't just right. Here are some latest trends in fashion jewelry that could well be the flavor of this season. Remember those spiral choker bands of the 1990s? This magnificent piece of jewelry originated back in the 1700s and continued through the French Revolution. A choker sits snugly around your neck and is available in several widths. They have witnessed a resurgence in popularity of late. From the bold spikes to the more traditional motifs adorned with diamonds, metals, and precious stones, the chokers are among the latest trends in fashion jewelry, available in an array of forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/udAYV6iJrao?rel=0&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;fs=0&amp;disablekb=1&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen title=&quot;10 Craziest&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should be an integral part of a woman's wardrobe because it highlights the collar bone and neck, the most beautiful part of her body. The ring bracelet is one of the most delicate and sophisticated items and is among the latest trends in fashion jewelry. It adorns the wrist and the fingers. Usually worn with a formal or elegant looking dress, the ring bracelet is actually a traditional bridal accessory. You can opt for the contemporary looking or the single chained one for a western outfit. Besides, it's good to wear an ornament on the hand because that looks feminine and beautiful. In the past couple of years, traditional jewelry designs became boring and the ring bracelet has emerged as a welcome deviation. This is a new entrant into the fashion jewelry market. The mesh has gained prominence mostly as a trendy accessory. It's actually a malleable net of metallic wire. The twisted, woven, and braided are the most common meshes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They even make for great hair accessories. A chunky mesh necklace coupled with a plain dress can give a complete look. A delicate mesh necklace, on the other hand, can help sport a dainty look. A mesh necklace can be worn with a matching piece or individually. The braided, woven, and twisted mesh gives the ornament a modern tint. Lightweight and durable, it can be worn for long hours. You can kill the monotony of dangling earrings and regular tops with the Ear cuff. It has emerged as a clear front runner in the latest trends in fashion jewelry. It's a semi-hoop that traces the ear and clings onto the cartilage. You can choose from Gothic and traditional motifs to the more contemporary floral designs. While casual attire demands a simpler, oversized ear cuff, the floral designs forge a bolder look for any evening wear. Many ear cuffs are studded with precious stones.

&lt;p&gt;As a parent, you can buy your kids this New York Knicks player's jersey on their birthdays and make the whole occasion a memorable one. Also, if your friend is crazy for Jeremy Lin, then there would not be any other gift option better than a Jeremy Lin jersey. As most of us know, the journey of Jeremy Lin to become what he is has been very difficult. He had to face a number of setbacks that could have let any normal person feel discouraged and demotivated. But it was the never ending passion about basketball and the strong determination which kept Lin going, no matter what. Thus, Jeremy Lin is an inspiration to many youngsters and has thereby become a hero overnight. It is also essential to understand that, wearing a basketball player jersey is not everything about supporting, but it creates a special bond between the fan and the player. Thus, by wearing a Jeremy Lin shirt, you may feel the essence of belongingness and perhaps the passion too, which Lin has.&lt;/p&gt;

Not only did he end the 74 year absence of a British Wimbledon finalist, he went on to offer us the prospect of the first British Wimbledon victory since 1936 - and his failure to clinch it might just have been more beneficial to his public profile than the win that was within his grasp. We at the sports and online public relations firm ENS are used to maximising every situation to advantage, and if anything, Andy's emotional reaction to the support of his fans gave him the image he needed to gain the support of the sports-crazed nation in the run-up to the Olympics. His loss meant that the public wanted him to do it, make that final step and take a title. His subsequent Olympic victory, therefore, and his equally impressive doubles performance with Laura Robson (which proved that he is a team player, not just a cold-hearted tennis machine) was enough to cement his reputation in the eyes of the average pundit of the genuine profundity of his talent.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media2.cgtrader.com/variants/wsJWbgwxsZDmWHQvBz7E9Tnb/9cae6891d5963582c5a024dd4cd2d77f44d540a2ca4f778b8c6afa6918049521/Trend%202.jpg&quot; class=&quot;wp-post-image&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 335px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Here&acirc;Äôs how sports tourism is growing. Whether it&acirc;Äôs traveling to play in a softball tournament with your league, to run a marathon, or to watch your favorite team play football, sports tourism is something most of us will participate in at some point in our lives. It&acirc;Äôs a good hobby for participants and spectators, and it&acirc;Äôs great for the economy as it generates lots of revenue. Sports tourism is traditional. It&acirc;Äôs exciting. It&acirc;Äôs not a new craze, but it&acirc;Äôs constantly growing, and experts believe its evolution will continue. From small-scale baseball leagues to something as large scale as the Olympics, people have always been willing to travel to watch or participate in sports. Although sports tourism is a tradition that&acirc;Äôs been around for many years, it is now growing at an even faster pace. Experts believe it will reach record highs and generate more revenue than ever in the near future. Don Schumacher, executive director of National Association of Sports Commissions, projects that hotel bookings will increase by 3 to 4 percent in 2016 over 2015 as a result of the ongoing rise of sports tourism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='https://storage.cgtrader.com/rails/active_storage/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBMGZOSUE9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--df1a0d171f1f48cb3fc323ba5831b512d39b20ca/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdCam9VWTI5dFltbHVaVjl2Y0hScGIyNXpld282QzNKbGMybDZaVWtpRFRZM05uZzFNREErQmpvR1JVWTZER2R5WVhacGRIazZDMk5sYm5SbGNqb01kVzV6YUdGeWNFa2lFakl1Tkhnd0xqUXJNUzQzS3pBR093ZFVPZzVwYm5SbGNteGhZMlZKSWdwUWJHRnVaUVk3QjFRNkRIRjFZV3hwZEhscFdnPT0iLCJleHAiOm51bGwsInB1ciI6InZhcmlhdGlvbiJ9fQ==--623c6a310f0f834f948241cae8d918ff137f5aa9/caliper-3d-model-max-obj-3ds-c4d-ma-mb-mtl.jpg' style='clear:both; float:left; padding:10px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px; max-width: 335px;'&gt;Competitor Group has been accused of using volunteers as free labor for its for-profit faces and is the target of a pending lawsuit as a result. This could hit a little close to home for many host committees for sporting events. It seems that larger cities may begin paying some that were formerly volunteer positions. This could increase the cost of the events and could possibly change the sports tourism industry for smaller events. Lacrosse has become increasingly popular in the younger crowds and active seniors are popularizing pickleball (which can be played on basketball, volleyball or tennis courts). Another sport on the rise is girls&acirc;Äô fast-pitch softball. It&acirc;Äôs no secret that free wifi is a crowd-pleaser and even an attraction in itself. Many people will choose their hotel or restaurants based off of the availability of (free) wifi. Experts believe that it will become a staple of events, up there with accessible parking and restrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sponsorships for events should be mutually beneficial. The best relationships with sponsors (and consequently, more funding) will be based on the way a sponsorship garners brand recognition. If it isn&acirc;Äôt advantageous to the sponsors, the money probably won&acirc;Äôt continue to come in, and the ideal sponsorship develops into an ongoing relationship. In the same way, it&acirc;Äôs important that the event and marketing be structured in such a way that will draw sponsors that are a good fit. It&acirc;Äôs not just Olympics or professional leagues; small events are drawing more and more spectatorial travel, and this trend is only expected to keep growing. Sports departments are no longer sticking to just the traditional sports tourism events. Today, they are venturing into the world of specialty events. After all, planning a festival or a car show requires a very similar skill set as planning a sporting event. This expanded focus will open DMO&acirc;Äôs up to generate more revenue. Partnering with a hotel near or even attached to the event location would eliminate the absolute need for transportation, which would make sports tourism more convenient and inexpensive for attendees and participants. 9. The Rest of the World Following the U.S. Where most countries outside of the U.S. U.S. has drawn support with local sponsorships. As government funding disappears worldwide, other countries will soon be taking after the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&acirc;ÄúWhat we can do is continue to offer really specialized high-performance stuff that the importers are not going to offer because there isn&acirc;Äôt enough volume or profit in the hand-built, one-off types of parts that we do,&acirc;Äù he explained, adding that there&acirc;Äôs still plenty of room for all players as the market continues to expand. &acirc;ÄúEven though our piece of the pie is getting smaller, it&acirc;Äôs a smaller piece of a much bigger pie,&acirc;Äù he said. &acirc;ÄúIt&acirc;Äôs still the same volume. We haven&acirc;Äôt seen any decrease in our sales. Back at Boss Audio, Hannon said that a similar trend has rippled through the mobile sound segment. &acirc;ÄúThe market has grown exponentially over the last few years,&acirc;Äù he said. &acirc;ÄúThere have been a lot of people jumping in and out of the market on the audio side. It&acirc;Äôs not an easy market to be in; there are a lot of things to keep in mind while you&acirc;Äôre building the product.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, we are not surprised! With the current trend of competitiveness, many companies around the world are bleeding losses. There are not many ways to break this rut and the simplest way out of it would be to concentrate on better quality of service or even reconsider the location of business. Now, many investors around the world are looking at placing their money in different locations that would be able to bring out better dividends that most - here is when a business setup UAE comes to the fore. There are not many places that are as supportive in investment like UAE. The country is also called the 'land of opportunity for investors' &amp; it comes as no surprise. People across the world are looking at investing in UAE only because of the huge profits that are at stake and the creditability that is linked with such existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background:rgba(0,0,0,0.1);padding:0px 10px 1px 10px;border-radius:5px;border:1px solid #000;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.asoif.com/sites/default/files/download/future_of_global_sport.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Future of Global Sport - ASOIF&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;cite&gt;www.asoif.com&lt;span class=&quot;eipWBe&quot;&gt; &acirc;Ä&ordm; download&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;color:rgba(0,0,0,0.6);&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Global Trends&lt;/em&gt; Impacting the &lt;em&gt;Sports&lt;/em&gt; Sector a. ...

While the &lt;em&gt;trend&lt;/em&gt; of new sporting formats and leagues.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have the obvious benefit of being known around the world just because you have the advantage of being present in Dubai. It has more or less become the tourism and financial hub of the world today. Right from massive financial deals to sport recreation to events - Dubai does make a shining location! With such a presence, it comes as no surprise that an investment here would lead to better profits. Think about it, you would have the advantage of reaching out to bigger masses. Something that may not be possible otherwise! UAE has the distinct advantage of opening up many free zones in the area that would give you clearer set up advantages than any other place in the world. You are given 100% ownership of your organisation and also huge tax advantages. This in itself comes as the biggest attraction for any investor - big or small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the global market condition, this is a huge relief to investors. Off shore funds can be placed with zero tax on the same. The freedom of recruitment is also an advantage in these free zones. Obviously, a business setup UAE requires a lot of people supporting you through the process. Having the power to choose your work force is a huge advantages offered here. While many of us look at these advantages, we do not think of the infrastructure benefits that come with UAE. It is one of the biggest positives in the world. Impeccable driving and road conditions along with strong energy sources are just one of the few. Petroleum and it's by products are cheaper than other countries too. You have the metro running that makes connectivity extremely easy. People have plenty of recreation that makes the working conditions all the more better. Cost of living and rentals are average which makes it affordable for the working class people. Not to forget the quality of living that is brought out here. When you think about the different kinds of advantages, there is little doubt that an investment in UAE is a big plus point for your business today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scuba diving that has become a recent trend nowadays truly has an immense significance in the world of adventure. An amazing sport, scuba diving has now become famous through out the whole world for physical as well as social enrichment. When some people are seen to get highly interested to this astounding activity for some body exercise, some are found to take it as their grand career. Also, it&acirc;Äôs not at all necessary to be a good athlete, in case you are going to try it for the first time. All you need to remember is consult a good doctor before you make your first attempt. As the activity needs a rigorous strength from your end, it&acirc;Äôs always suggested not to go for it, if you have certain health problems. If you are keen enough to fortify your fitness to a great extent, then scuba diving will prove to be highly functional for your good health.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Travel To Restart Travel Between Australia And New Zealand]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;img style='max-width: 370px;' class='wp-post-image' src=&quot;https://media2.cgtrader.com/variants/XUdKxS3APmK8x5jbHM5jN3ch/9cae6891d5963582c5a024dd4cd2d77f44d540a2ca4f778b8c6afa6918049521/Penny%20Neon%20High%20Heel%202.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;A href=&quot;https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/sports-apparel-market&quot;&gt;The plan&lt;/A&gt; to restart travel between Australia and New Zealand will hugely benefit both countries and help get their economies back on track, a tourism expert has told Daily Mail Australia. The two neighbours have closed their borders to all non-citizens and imposed mandatory quarantines on anyone returning home from overseas to stop the spread of COVID-19. But as both nations prepare to ease restrictions having successfully reduced the rate of infection, leaders Scott Morrison and Jacinda Ardern have been discussing a 'trans-Tasman' travel bubble to boost jobs and growth while keeping their people protected from the rest of the world where the virus is still rife. The plan to restart travel between Australia and New Zealand will hugely benefit both countries and help get their economies back on track, a tourism expert has told Daily Mail Australia. Travel experts say the New Zealand and Australian tourism markets are alike because of cultural similarities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media1.cgtrader.com/variants/1jA4hKXfivPNSgAarDJ6hQPw/9cae6891d5963582c5a024dd4cd2d77f44d540a2ca4f778b8c6afa6918049521/4.jpg&quot; style='clear:both; float:right; padding:10px 0px 10px 10px; border:0px; max-width: 370px;'&gt;New Zealand is Australia's second-biggest international tourism market after China with 1.4million visitors a year while 1.5million Australians go to New Zealand every year representing the county's biggest market. Before coronavirus stuck, tourism supported 924,600 jobs in Australia and 229,566 jobs in New Zealand - around eight per cent of the workforce in each country - but almost all of these roles have been affected by the crisis. Freya Higgins-Desbiolles, a senior Lecturer in Tourism Management at University of South Australia, said restarting travel will help repair the immense damage inflicted on the tourism industry due to COVID-19. If we want to get our restaurants, cafes, pubs and clubs open again then restarting tourism is a key way to revive ourselves,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Australia and New Zealand are good travel markets for each other because we are cousins and we understand each other well - we are both big drinkers, and we enjoy sport and wine and food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Higgins-Desbiolles said international tourism between the two countries will particularly benefit regional areas. Aussie and Kiwi tourists are generally repeat visitors to each other's countries meaning they don't just visit the big cities,' she said. Some 71 per cent of Australian tourists rent cars in New Zealand, meaning they visit diverse areas,' she added. Asked if people will be keen to travel abroad in economically difficult times, she said: 'I think the lack of certainty may make some people careful with their money but others will be dying to get out. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Tuesday became the first world leader to join an Australian Cabinet meeting in more than 60 years when she was invited to discuss the travel bubble. Her foreign minister Winston Peters has backed the plan and compared the fight against coronavirus to the First World War when Australian and Kiwi troops fought alongside each other in Gallipoli and France. Both of our countries have had enormous success in the way we attacked COVID-19. We see this as the Anzacs, one people in a bubble, albeit two countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time is of the essence in terms of our economies and we see ourselves as one for the purpose of economic recovery,' he told ABC News on Tuesday. The coronavirus crisis could strengthen our regional bond as people might decide not to travel as far as Europe and the US,' said Dr Higgins-Desbiolles. Dr Higgins-Desbiolles also said the travel bubble will revive the ANZAC spirit. In the past we have been competitors, but COVID is reminding us how much we have to share,' she said. Indeed, a 2015 study by McKinsey Global Consultancy described New Zealand and Australia as the two 'most connected countries' in the world, even ahead of the US and Canada. Dr Higgins-Desbiolles said the coronavirus crisis could have a lasting impact on tourism between the two countries. The coronavirus crisis could strengthen our regional bond as people might decide not to travel as far as Europe and the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travel between our nations could become extension of the buy-local ethos to support our local communities. More sustainable short-haul travel could be a long-term trend,' she said. Ms Ardern has she said reopening travel between the the two countries would take a while to work through. When we feel comfortable and confident that we both won't receive cases from Australia, but equally that we won't export them, then that will be the time to move,' she told reporters in Wellington on Tuesday. Mr Morrison said travel across the Tasman Sea between the neighbours would be the first international route restarted and would likely begin around the time domestic air travel restarts in earnest. When we are seeing Australians travel from Melbourne to Cairns, at about that time I would expect everything being equal we would be able to fly from Melbourne to Auckland or Christchurch,' Mr Morrison told reporters in Canberra.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;American professional sports leagues plotting their path back from the coronavirus shutdown are preparing for a future played out behind closed doors or to sparsely populated arenas, scenarios that analysts say are likely to carry a heavy financial burden and could lead to profound changes. Although plans to resume action have yet to be finalized, Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League are reportedly mulling proposals that include playing games in empty stadia or in clusters of large, confined fan-free zones. Basketball and ice hockey, who were both approaching the business end of their respective seasons before the leagues shut down in March, are likely to enjoy a television ratings bonanza if and when competition resumes. Andrew Zimbalist, a professor of Economics at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. But given their economic model, do all the championships have a financial interest in playing without spectators? Of the four major leagues, the NHL has the most to lose in any future played behind closed doors, Zimbalist said. In the case of smaller leagues, the equation could be even more problematic, Zimbalist warned.&lt;/p&gt;

As leagues prepare for a future without fans, specialist firms are already working to create solutions that will mask swathes of empty seats. For Mark Williams, of the architectural firm HKS, the constraint is also an opportunity to innovate. Williams points to SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, the newly constructed multi-billion-dollar arena due to open this year that will be home to the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers NFL teams. The futuristic arena is packed with technology, including a giant double-sided hanging screen that surrounds the entire field and could be used to dress the empty stadium. He said the innovations under consideration have accelerated a trend that was already under way, namely the rise of technology in sport and the conquest of large audiences who rarely go to games.&lt;/p&gt;

But why? ISPO.com has been asking around the scene and researching what makes sex appeal. The best ...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the short-term points to arenas without spectators, leagues and championships also have an eye on a future where fans are allowed back into stadia while respecting social distancing rules. Williams believes that scenario will probably require an additional layer of temperature checks at entry points in the same way that security checkpoints became standard after 9/11. Once inside, social distancing rules will mean that two out of three seats could be empty, he predicted. A more fundamental problem may even be persuading fans, many of whom fear contagion, to consider returning to stadiums. That reluctance may be exacerbated by financial hardship. Zimbalist noted that fans struck by the economic crisis will have less money to spend. Fans may only feel fully confident about returning to arenas when a coronavirus vaccine is developed and available. Williams therefore does not rule out the possibility that certain arenas or stadiums could be reinvented with a longer-term perspective in mind, with fewer and more expensive seats. Others doubt whether the pandemic will lead to lasting changes in the look and feel of sports stadiums.

&lt;p&gt;Google Goggles is said to be like the design of Oakley Thump and will overlay the screen with contextual information as opposed to browser-like pages we see on smartphones. Operating it can be as simple as tilting your head back and forth. And although these spectacles can look really cool, they are not designed for constant use. With it, comes inherent privacy concerns. Perhaps that's a reason why Google is taking its time before launching the product, and rightly so. People should at least be able to tell if they are being recorded by a person with a camera on his eyewear. Now these ultra modern glasses seem to be one of the pieces Google wants to have in order to know what users are doing and where they are going to 24/7. Recently, Google has already announced a unification of its 60 online services for, apparently, continuous online tracking. The Google Goggles will reportedly cost up to USD 600, just like a smartphone, and will be available before the year ends. As of new, Google does not seem ready to deny or confirm anything about a smart eyewear in development.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Fashion Styles - When Trends Just Come And Go]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Fashion style is one of the many things that changes in just a short period of time. One moment people are going crazy over colored skinny jeans, tomorrow they will be craving for designer rolling briefcases and apparel. The thing there is, people may change their preferences on certain pieces of fashion, but definitely, all of them will always go back to the basic. Fashion is a never-ending cycle. What is in now may come from long time ago, just making their appearance visible once again. If you can remember it right, super-skinny jeans are people's favorites like twenty years ago. But before that, bell-bottoms dominated the market. Compare everything to the present situation. The craze for skinny jeans is back, but actually, four years ago, every single kid on the block has a pair of bell-bottom jeans. And If truth be told, the same cycle will be repeated for the next years to come. Let us go to the cycle of bags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;			&lt;/li&gt;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the 90's, girls are going gaga over shoulder bags to use when shopping. They come in different colors, accompanied with very long bag straps that can go all the way to your legs. These changed when teenagers as well as young professionals are starting to sport the new star-hand bags and purses. It stayed for quite sometime making the handbag designers filthy rich because some of these can be quite expensive to put it mildly. Years after the fad, shoulder bags are slowly dominating the scene once again. Even men, who are generally not fond of these apparels, are going the trend as well. From the hand-held briefcases and file organizers, rolling briefcases can also be seen around. Briefcases for men are designed especially for the male population so they can have a trend of their own without having to go with the women's choices. It will only take a not so long time before the original fad would have to go back. Shoes are undergoing some rapid changes as well. Some may be patterned to the old school shoes, yet some are evolving into different pieces. With heels that can go as high as 4 inches and even beyond (with the help of platforms), even women who lacks height can solve that issue. Apparels are also taking a few flashbacks. Fashion styles are never stagnant. In just a couple of years or less, the trend that you thought would last for a very long time will just disappear right before your eyes and will be overthrown by the new kid on the block. It is only a matter of how long will it survive the dynamic surroundings of the fashion world, and will it even leave a mark in the scene, or will it be just another fashion faux pas.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[ESports Trends Brands Must Be Aware Of]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;A few statistics should cause marketing teams to worry about a generational shift that is happening in the world of sport and entertainment. There are 2.2bn people globally who play video games. That is about the same number of sports fans in the world. In the UK last year, the gaming market was bigger than the music and video markets combined. In 2019, competitive gaming, or eSports, will have 454 million participants and revenues of $1.1bn - 26% growth, according to the latest Newzoo eSports Report estimates. By 2022 the report estimates those figures will be 645 million participants with revenues as high as $3.2bn. This is not just a few geeky kids playing in their attics. This is a generation that is redefining what is sport and what is entertainment. Brands need to understand the scale of this change because the danger is they underestimate the differences of this community of gamers - or make the mistake of thinking of them in terms of traditional sports fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eSports community is something entirely different. Quite apart from being hard to reach in more conventional ways, the level of engagement and immersion in the games they are playing or watching is on another level to that of a traditional fan. Hard to imagine. But true. Like it or not, eSports and competitive gaming have become a way of life for hundreds of millions of young people. It will continue to grow, the only question is by how much and how quickly. The answer lies in the willingness of games publishers, rights holders, brands and eSports companies like Gfinity to think and act differently, and be prepared to adapt their business models in new ways. The Newzoo report highlights two trends that we have seen emerging that present interesting opportunities for brands wanting to enter this space. First, the growing importance of giving fans a &acirc;Äòreason to care&acirc;Äô and be vested in the teams. Teams and eSports professionals increasingly understand this. To date, most teams have tended to lack a brand personality - there is little depth to the relationship between fan and the &acirc;Äòstars&acirc;Äô.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the winner of last year&acirc;Äôs Overwatch League was London Spitfire, the London team in the Overwatch franchise. And yet none of the players come from London or the UK and they rarely visit. While London Spitfire has a global fan base it is going to be important that the team builds a core and loyal UK fan community. This will undoubtedly happen. In a world where there is so much content already available, the challenge is to make the pros and the teams they represent engaging in a way that resonates and matters to gamers. Great opportunity for brands. The other trend is a growing desire to extend beyond just watching tournament play, either live or via a channel. There is an appetite for new types of shows and competition formats, bringing more of an entertainment approach to gaming. More people on the eSports channel Twitch watch live streaming of their heroes playing popular games than watching the &acirc;Äòbest of the best&acirc;Äô in live tournament play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m4RjJvZ4mjE/hqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;How To Train Like A Pro Cyclist - Structure Your Winter Training Like A Pro - &euml;èô&igrave;òÅ&igrave;ÉÅ&quot; class='wp-post-image' style=&quot;max-width: 345px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;What&acirc;Äôs next? It will be the growing involvement of professional athletes from the worlds of football, NBA and NFL, as well as entertainers from the worlds of television, film and music who love gaming, pulling their game-loving fans into the broader eSports space. This is where the opportunities for new ideas and content are endless - and where the white space exists for brands to play. Imagine you like playing the Fifa video game and you get the chance to watch one of your favourite Premier League stars like Dele Alli play the same game against his team mates or star players from rival clubs anywhere in the world. Or for that matter a music or entertainment star. The picking of the teams, the banter, the forfeits, innovative gameplay formats and so on. The gameplay is peripheral. The level of engagement, unbeatable. This is where brands can play and add value.&lt;/p&gt;

A wrestling bout is a physical competition, between two (occasionally more) competitors or sparring partners, who attempt to gain and maintain a superior position. Are you tired of missing your favorite WWE matches, because you are always travelling or your cable connection is bad? Here is the latest technology, where you can streamline the matches on your computer or laptop and can watch them online. All you need is a good connection of internet and a PC or any device which supports web and you are on roll. The new band of websites, which have come up in the market not only provide excellent picture quality but ensure that there is no breakage in the live action of wrestling, provided your internet connection is good. 4. For paid services, please check the number of channels the site is offering and what existing servers they have? Obviously you do not expect me to provide you a list of these sites. This is a perfect medium for all you die hard WWE fans to enjoy wrestling without the idiot box. Raw wrestling is a show where you can watch combat de catch (wrestling) streaming. Images and videos posted are those of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). The wrestling are conducted and prepared by professionals and offer a breathtaking realism. The video catch (video wrestling) takes place mostly in the United States. It may happened that the public steps into the ring and joins the fight. Commentators often exaggerate movements and strokes. There are no strict rules for the Catch, the principal is staged for the direct and nobody get hurt!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width: 350px;&quot; class=&quot;wp-post-image&quot; src='https://farm1.static.flickr.com/726/21805054436_4b20a7b85f.jpg'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&acirc;ÄúI&acirc;Äôve lived long enough to see trends, and this is a very dangerous trend. Everybody talks about it, but who&acirc;Äôs doing anything about it? Nearly 45 years after Frank Robinson became baseball&acirc;Äôs first African American manager, baseball has a problem with its hiring practices. Blacks are disproportionately overlooked. White owners tend to hire white general managers who tend to hire white managers, and the results are clear. Perhaps it&acirc;Äôs not surprising. There are no African American majority owners - the only one of color is the Angels&acirc;Äô Arte Moreno - or chief executives. At last month&acirc;Äôs general manager meetings in Scottsdale, Ariz., when teams made their executives available to reporters in a hotel ballroom, just one African American was present: Michael Hill of the Marlins. Is Nicholas Castellanos answer to Giants&acirc;Äô outfield needs? &acirc;ÄúI think baseball has to do more to address this,&acirc;Äù said Richard Lapchick, who studies racial and gender hiring practices and gives annual report cards as the director of the University of Central Florida&acirc;Äôs Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&acirc;ÄúI believe they&acirc;Äôre earnestly trying to increase the number of African American players with their various programs that they have throughout the country, particularly the RBI (Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities) program. Major League Baseball officials say progress is being made at the grassroots level with several programs, including those designed to bring more African American players and managers to the big leagues. Among the youth initiatives in underserved communities, RBI encourages participation. As part of another initiative, 10 youth academies have been set up in the U.S. Plus, a tour of several cities is being arranged to identify talent among eighth- to 11th-graders, including a stop in Oakland in May. Furthermore, MLB launched the Diversity Pipeline Program in 2016 to attract and develop a pool of minority and female candidates for high-level positions on the field and off. &acirc;ÄúYou can&acirc;Äôt hide from it. Tyrone Brooks, senior director of MLB&acirc;Äôs pipeline program, said he&acirc;Äôs encouraged with the young group of African American candidates. &acirc;ÄúWe have a budding group coming along that just entered the process for the first time,&acirc;Äù Brooks said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five African Americans were interviewed for managerial jobs this offseason, including Will Venable, 37, by Giants president of baseball operations Farhan Zaidi. The job went to Gabe Kapler. Johnny Washington, 35, interviewed with the Angels, who hired Joe Maddon, and George Lombard, 44, interviewed with the Pirates, who hired Derek Shelton. Furthermore, Baker, 70, and Ron Washington, 67, were finalists in Philadelphia and San Diego, respectively. The jobs went to Joe Girardi and Jayce Tingler. In fact, all five jobs went to white men. &acirc;ÄúWe haven&acirc;Äôt made any progress,&acirc;Äù said Baker, who managed the Giants for 10 seasons. Selig Rule: Mandates that minorities be included in interviews for manager, general manager and scouting director openings. Diversity Pipeline: Seeks to identify, develop and grow the pool of qualified minority and female candidates for on-field and baseball operations positions. Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities: Creates affordable league opportunities in underserved and diverse communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Youth academies: Provides affordable instruction in 10 U.S. The Tour: Recognizes select talent among eighth- to 11th-graders in several cities, including a stop in Oakland next May. Diversity-focused development camps: Draws high school-aged players to spring training-type environments where they receive training from former big-league players and are seen by college and pro scouts. It&acirc;Äôs a similar story among high-level executives; only Hill and White Sox executive vice president of baseball operations Kenny Williams are African American. The only other minorities in those roles include Zaidi, who&acirc;Äôs of Pakistani heritage, and Tigers GM Al Avila, who&acirc;Äôs Latino. Brooks sees African Americans receiving more managing opportunities in the future and cited 43-year-old James Rowson, Minnesota&acirc;Äôs hitting coach the past three years and now the Marlins&acirc;Äô bench coach, as an excellent candidate. Rowson interviewed last year with the Twins and Angels. There is no shortage of candidates. If succeeding as a Triple-A manager is important, Gary Jones, Pat Listach, DeMarlo Hale, Bobby Meacham and Glenallen Hill would be nice options.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Top Professional Sports Leagues By Revenue]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The NBA finals just ended and the Cleveland Cavaliers took home the championship trophy. The stunning trophy, covered in gold, is testament to the flash and prestige of sports leagues across the globe. Each major sporting group has its own way of doing things, complete with stunning performances, millions of screaming fans and an impressive grand prize at the end. Although the debate over which sport is best will rage on forever, we can answer the question which sports league makes the most money? Below you will find an infographic of the wealthiest sports leagues by revenue. You can see the top 20 sports teams shown by each individual logo in order of revenue from right to left, with revenues placed above each logo. There are two major patterns that can be seen from our infographic. First, football leagues dominate the top chart. Now, there is a big debate over the use of the term football. America and a few other countries use the term soccer, while most of the world uses the term football.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, it&acirc;Äôs an extremely popular sport. Out of the top 20 leagues by revenue, 14 are associated football groups. These leagues make a combined $19.442 billion and most of them are unsurprisingly located in Europe. You may also be able to see the popularity of a sport in a certain region. European football leagues enjoy large revenues due to their popularity. Although America&acirc;Äôs Major League Soccer (MLS) takes the 18th spot on our list, its revenues are well below the major European football leagues. In comparison, the Premier League in England and Wales makes $5.3 billion, making it the top football league by revenue. The second major trend that you should notice is that the top 5 positions are dominated by American/Canadian sports leagues. Not only are 4 out of the top 5 positions held by American/Canadian leagues, the revenue of these leagues far outpaces all others. The National Football League alone commands $13 billion in revenue, giving it the top spot overall by a huge amount.&lt;/p&gt;

When you add in the NBA and NHL, the combined revenue is $31 billion, which is much more than the other 16 top sports leagues in total. Another smaller trend to notice is the diversity of sports leagues in America and Canada. While all of Europe&acirc;Äôs top sports leagues involve football, America&acirc;Äôs and Canada&acirc;Äôs top leagues by revenue span 5 different sports: American Football, Baseball, Basketball, Ice Hockey and Football (soccer). Europeans as well as others certainty enjoy their football, while American and Canadians seem to enjoy a more diverse set of sports. Although football leagues are various and post decent revenues, the sports leagues coming out of North America make far more money. Which Professional Sports Leagues Make the Most Money?

The city never shut down its subway system, which millions depend on for transportation. Sheinbaum's reopening plan included some of the industries that the federal government already approved to return to work like construction, but also adds bicycle sales and beer production. The mayor said bike shops are being exempted because she wants to promote bicycle use as a way to help improve the health of city residents. As elsewhere around the world, Mexico's COVID-19 dead have included a high percentage of people suffering from ailments such as diabetes and obesity. Some businesses never shut down in the city, but did implement social distancing measures. At an office goods store in a central neighborhood Wednesday, a dozen people lined up in the parking lot outside. A security guard with a mask and bottle of hand sanitizer let customers enter one at a time only when an employee was available to escort them and after a squirt of gel on their hands.&lt;/p&gt;

The betting service also received recognition from a lot of government agencies because of its revolutionary and different manner of betting. The recognitions make the service a legal and credible service. Price per head is not just a sports betting service. While allowing the sports enthusiasts to be excited when betting for their chosen teams, the betting also provides opportunities for people to gain decent cash. There are also a lot of modes in which a better can bet his cash, like opting to go for series bets. Series bets are when a person bets on a series of consecutive games. No matter which side the better has placed his bet on, the bet will cover the five consecutive games of the particular team. The more the number of games the specific team wins, the more the amount of cash the better can earn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brit called for Onischenko&acirc;Äôs epee to be examined and it was then that a network of wires was found under a pressure pad in the handle. It transpired the Soviet had been triggering the scoring system at will. A scandal in any language but there was a bigger picture to think of. &acirc;ÄòWhat you have to remember is that I was very publicly a member of the British Army and Boris was a half-colonel in the KGB,&acirc;Äô recalled Fox. Britain would go on to win the modern pentathlon gold. Onischenko, meanwhile, was called before Leonid Brezhnev for a dressing down and was dismissed from the Red Army. He was last known to be working as a taxi driver in Kiev. If the beauty of the Olympics is the test of self, then the agony is surely when the margins of failure are miniscule. All that was needed was for Muhammad to stay out of the way. It is necessary to know at this point that the scoring system has only two blows that can exceed a two-point margin and with a spinning kick to Muhammad&acirc;Äôs head, Cisse found one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four-pointer gave him an 8-6 win and Muhammad&acirc;Äôs tears became one of the defining images of the Games. Ann Packer arrived at the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo as a favourite to win the 400m gold medal for Britain. What played out was a glorious divergence from the plan. She had twice broken the Olympic record in reaching the final, where she then set a European record but could only finish second. Dismayed, she was teetering on skipping the 800m, for which she was also entered and briefly considered going on a shopping trip instead. However, the fact her boyfriend, the GB captain Robbie Brightwell, had underperformed in the men&acirc;Äôs 400m after a political issue with team bosses served as the jolt to get up and run again. Having only contested the 800m distance five times before, and never at any meaningful meet, Packer went on to break the world record and take gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She quit after the Olympics, aged 22, and has been married to Brightwell ever since. Two of their sons, Ian and David, went on to play for Manchester City. Women&acirc;Äôs boxing remained an unconquered frontier in the push for equality prior to London 2012. With those Games including it for the first time, the world came to know and then love the wonderful movement and beaming smile of a softly spoken Leeds flyweight called Nicola Adams. She danced her way to the final where she faced China&acirc;Äôs Ren Cancan, a three-time world champion who, ominously, had made a habit of beating Adams in major fights. &acirc;ÄòLosing to her is starting to annoy me,&acirc;Äô Adams had told Sportsmail in the months ahead of the Games. She went on to crush Ren 16-7 for gold, then won another at Rio 2016. Her place among British Olympic greats is secured. On August 16, 2016, something unique happened. Jason Kenny won the men&acirc;Äôs keirin to take his sixth gold medal and tie Chris Hoy as Britain&acirc;Äôs most successful Olympian. On the same day his fiancee, Laura Trott, won the omnium to take her personal tally to four golds, making her the nation&acirc;Äôs most garlanded female Olympian. Between them, they have 10 gold medals. In the delirium of that day, Trott took to Twitter and posted: &acirc;ÄòI love him to bits. Our kids have to get some of these genes, right? They married a month later.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media1.cgtrader.com/variants/LKHTb2hDqsZARVoe5cP8TajM/9cae6891d5963582c5a024dd4cd2d77f44d540a2ca4f778b8c6afa6918049521/screenshot001.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class='wp-post-image' style='clear:both; float:right; padding:10px 0px 10px 10px; border:0px; max-width: 300px;'&gt;We all love celebrities for their fabulous style statements and incredible fashion sense. Models, singers, and actors change the fashion trends with a change in their wardrobe and vanity. Be it makeup, dresses, shoes, hair dos or accessories, celebrities have been defining the trends since ages. Talking about hairdos, celebrities' hair is worth millions. Even a flick cut in a different way can start a new trend, prevalent among millions of fans. Justin Beiber's haircut became a rage within minutes among the youth all across the world. A lesser known and noticed fact is that many beloved celebrities use wigs to create a style statement. Fiddling with natural hair can be too much of a risk for them. Therefore, many celebs often go for lace wigs, which they can use safely to bring a change in their looks. These wigs allow the celebrities to revamp their looks without any permanent changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of African-American celebrities have supported lace wigs to get a fashionable look that is safe. Academy Award winner Halle Berry has used lace wigs innumerable times to sport a different avatar in a different movie. Similarly, the incredibly successful singer Rihanna, who has been remodelling the style statement for black women for years now, has used wigs many a time to add to the glamour quotient. Even if she is supporting a wig in one of her videos, her hair style did definitely opened a wide market for special 'Rihanna wigs' online and otherwise. Wigs allow celebrities like Rihanna to embrace the drama and hyperbolic style statements. The talk show queen Oprah Winfrey recently tweeted a picture of herself without any makeup and displaying all of her wigs. Winfrey has been seen using these hair pieces on television and is rumoured to use a few of these in an upcoming movie. Talking about the other gender, the musical maestro Prince too has a number of wigs that make him the star on stage that he is. The latest is Prince appearing in the Chappelle Show wearing a curly wig, purple ruffled blouse, and black eyeliner. Yet another example of a celeb styling lace wig is Janet Jackson. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pinterest.com/pin/437975132490564118/&quot;&gt;If you are wondering that how&lt;/a&gt; this gorgeous woman manages to have a perfect hair day every day, then chances are that most of the time she owes it to her wig collection. A good quality wig gives the celebrities that bouncy, shiny hair that stays perfect all throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are overlaps too with other niche tourism segments such as cultural tourism, eco-tourism, culinary and sports tourism, which makes sense. Actually, we believe that this tourism cluster in the field of Sports and health is the only way to offer a complete package to your customers. As sport tourism continues to gain momentum across the world, it opens up innovation avenues which can help improve the quality of life in different communities. Now in Greece we have an average of more than five sports events per weekend through the whole year. Running, swimming are among the most popular events and then sailing &amp; bike follows. Golf is another sector very popular in Europe and even if we have the best two European Pro-Am tournaments in Greece we are still struggling in this sector. The first step though is the golf courses. The second is to understand the age of Golf. Since as an agency we have been close to golf events since 2011 with Messinia Pro-Am, Aegean Pro-Am, Elounda Pro-Am, Hellenic-Turkish Friendship Golf Cup, we can say very honestly that GOLF IS NOT TOO OLD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 73% of UK Wealth (more than 10 trillion) comes from people over 50 years old. One out of 5 babyboomers (born 1946-1964) are millionaires. When you go back in 1990, there were more than 500 million people in the world over 60 - now there is a billion. These are people with disposable income. &acirc;Äôt forget in Golf the core. We need to do the same in sports tourism or wellness tourism (the global wellness economy is a $4.2 trillion market). Especially now that people are ready to live new adventures, new experiences. A vacation is a safe place to try new things because the whole experience of travel is about new discoveries, so sports tourism is about exploring and discovering ways of life that give you a new way of life. Ultimately, we travel to be inspired. We want to connect, to relax, to give back, and to give in. Be a traveler rather than a tourist.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Hold The Vodka: Russians Cut Drinking 40 Percent Under Putin]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The WHO put the decrease down to a raft of measures brought in since sport-loving President Vladimir Putin came to power in 2000, including restrictions on alcohol sales and the promotion of healthy lifestyles. The study showed a 43 percent drop in alcohol consumption per capita from 2003 to 2016, driven by a steep decline in the consumption of bootleg booze. The authors said this trend was a factor in increased life expectancies, which reached a historic peak in 2018, at 78 years for women and 68 years for men. Under Putin, Russia has introduced measures including a ban on shops selling any alcohol after 11:00 pm, increases in the minimum retail price of spirits and an advertising blackout. In a central Moscow bar that specialises in beer, drinkers said they thought people were cutting down partly because of the restrictions, particularly on late-night alcohol sales in shops, but also due to changing lifestyles. Alexander Sukhontsov, a 28-year-old bank employee, adding that people's busy schedules mean they &quot;just don't have the time&quot;. Roman Pechnikov, a 38-year-old computer scientist. But after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, alcohol consumption exploded, continuing to rise until the start of the 2000s. President Boris Yeltsin was also notorious for embarrassing public incidents that appeared to be alcohol-fuelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/q4MsDcuppDw?showinfo=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen title=&quot;The summer of The Nexus: WWE Playlist&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now the trend is creeping into the wider world of fitness. There are certainly no shortage of ways in which you can monitor your HRV. It can be recorded on an Apple Watch, some versions of FitBit (the Charge 3, Ionic and Versa), Polar chest-band heart-rate monitors, the Whoop wristband, the Oura ring (spotted on the fingers of Prince Harry and Will Smith), and through apps such as Wattson Blue, which allows you to record your HRV using the camera on your smartphone, and ithlete, which uses a finger sensor to take an HRV reading. But what does HRV really mean, and is it really worth adding to the ever-growing list of metrics we track? John Brewer, a professor of sport and exercise science at the University of Suffolk, explains that heart rate is not constant, pointing out that just because your resting heart rate reads as 60 beats per minute, that doesn&acirc;Äôt mean your heart beats once every second. He says: &acirc;ÄòIn a nutshell, your heart rate variability is a measure of your heart&acirc;Äôs electrical pattern, and the milliseconds between heart beats. There is no normal HRV level and no point in comparing yours with anyone else&acirc;Äôs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a rough guide, Whoop, which makes the fitness tracker of the same name, says that 20 to 25-year-olds usually have an average HRV in the 55 to 105 range, while 60 to 65-year-olds tend to be between 25 and 45. But what really matters is how your figure fluctuates on a daily basis - and the higher it stays, the better. Experts advise measuring in the morning. If you&acirc;Äôve have overdone it at the gym or if there have been too many &acirc;Äòstressors&acirc;Äô in your life, your HRV will drop - an early warning sign that you need time to recover. If, on the other hand, your HRV remains high, it means you have sufficient energy reserves to continue attacking any workout plan with gusto. Jim Pate, senior exercise physiologist at the Centre for Health and Human Performance, says: &acirc;ÄòStress affects the nervous system, which in turn causes the variability in the time between heartbeats to decrease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&acirc;ÄòIt is like having your foot constantly on the accelerator to maintain speed, rather than applying a little and then letting it off to coast. &acirc;ÄòSo, in simple terms, lower HRV signals higher levels of mental and physical stress.&acirc;Äô Studies have suggested exercising when HRV is high leads to greater gains in fitness, compared to exercising when HRV is lower. HRV has long been used by elite athletes seeking that extra physiological insight to give them the edge over rivals. And elite cyclists who tailored their training to their HRV improved performance significantly during training. But other researchers have found HRV makes no difference to exercise or sports performance, and Prof Brewer says: &acirc;ÄòThe jury is still out. It should not, says Prof Brewer, become an exercise obsession. &acirc;ÄòDon&acirc;Äôt read too much into HRV as it doesn&acirc;Äôt tell the whole story,&acirc;Äô he says. Often, the most reliable - if boring - way to tell if you are overdoing things is simply to listen to your body. Excessive fatigue, poor sleep, constantly struggling in classes or on runs and cycle rides despite no increases in workload are a sure sign as any that your body needs a rest. &acirc;ÄòThese classic complaints are often overlooked,&acirc;Äô says Pate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the day the center is open to phys-ed classes; after school, staff and students are able to use it. Students at both the high school and the middle school play some sports in gym classes, but high school students learn to play tennis, golf, and croquet as well. And included in the plans for a high school renovation project is construction of a 5,000-square-foot wellness center. Word of the programs is spreading and sparking interest among administrators in other districts. Recently, a group of phys-ed teachers, parents, and administrators from Davis County Schools in Owensboro, Kentucky, visited Madison Junior High School to see the fitness center and review the phys-ed curriculum. Charles Green, director of middle and secondary schools for Davis County Schools, says that though the system currently has a traditional phys-ed program, staff members think it is time for a change. Green explains. School officials are talking with administrators at the local hospital, Owensboro Mercy Health Systems, to determine whether the hospital will help fund the change to a fitness program, he adds. Federal funds now are available as well to pump up phys-ed programs. This month, the U.S. Department of Education released the guidelines for school systems applying for funds through the Physical Education for Progress Grant Program. The $5 million program provides grants so school systems can start, expand, or improve their phys-ed programs. P.E.4Life's Flannery says her organization has mobilized support for the program and advocates that a review of physical education standards be part of overall national education reform efforts.

Esports sponsorship has&lt;wbr&gt; ...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the investor side, the sports tech sector continues to attract a mix of backers, from angel investors and early-stage funds to private equity firms and corporations. Generally speaking, funding rounds attract multiple types of investors, but the report found a noticeable rise in interest among established VCs. In 2019, for example, VC funds were involved in three quarters of sports tech funding rounds, up from 67 per cent five years ago. By comparison, angel investors (34 per cent), early-stage funds (32 per cent) and corporate VCs (38 per cent) were involved in far fewer rounds. More than half of all investors reside in North America, with a vast majority of those based in the United States. However, the report found discrepancies between regions when it comes to the types of investors. In Europe, for example, there are a larger number of early-stage funds with a strong appetite for smaller deals.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Is Beer A Good Post-Exercise Recovery Drink?]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;To the uninitiated it can be a bit of a shock, but at the end of a weekend road race or triathlon, right next to the bananas and Gatorade, you are increasingly likely these days to find the beer tent. Geoffrey Pedder, 41, recently launched the Zelus Beer Company in Medfield, Mass., to capitalize on this growing trend. Pedder was convinced that because active people were drinking beer anyway, they'd be especially interested in drinking beer targeted especially at them. His range of choices have an ABV, or alcohol by volume, of less than 5%, rare among today's craft beer. If you think it sounds crazy to think of beer as a recovery drink, you're not alone. But the trend is catching on. Bart Watson, chief economist at the Brewers Association in Denver. Watson pointed out that cold beer and camaraderie - even at 10 a.m. Watson said, calling the rollout of light beer in the late 1970s and early '80s a &quot;revolution&quot; for the beer industry. He concedes, though, that while growing, the market is still tiny for &quot;lighter&quot; craft beer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width: 345px;&quot; class=&quot;wp-post-image&quot; src=&quot;https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5752/23816933342_6d80aeb41f.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;In terms of sales, it's about 1% of the craft beer market, which is about 13% of the overall beer market. At the Powisset Farm Trail Run in Dover, Mass., last month, runners thronged the table where Pedder and his wife were handing out beer. Christine Dinneen, 51, Stacy Cawley, 44, and Brooke Freeburg, 38, were each sipping a 16-ounce can of Zelus. Cawley said she isn't much of a beer drinker, but her two friends convinced her to try one. For Freeburg, it's the social aspect of having a beer that draws her, regardless of the sport. A study from 2015, published in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition, found that &quot;a moderate beer intake has no deleterious effects on markers of hydration in active individuals.&quot; In other words, a couple beers - especially ones with low alcohol - are OK, especially because beer, like sports drinks, contains carbs, electrolytes and sodium, which has been shown to help with fluid loss. No one here would say they're drinking beer specifically to recover from the race. Mostly they echoed what Pedder said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're going to drink beer anyway, so why not a lower-alcohol, lower-calorie can of suds that tastes good? Two other friends in the race felt the same way. Mark Southard, 62, and Rick Gill, 48, joked that they come to races like this for the beer. Building on this active lifestyle model, some craft brewers have actually gone the nonalcoholic route. Bill Shufelt co-founded Athletic Brewing two years ago. The company sells its brews at bars and restaurants in the Northeast. It also distributes to more than 2,000 stores nationwide. Shufelt told NPR in June. And the trend may keep growing. As NPR's Allison Aubrey reported, a survey by analysts at Bank of America last year found that 22% of millennials say they're drinking less - and when asked why, the majority said that increased concerns about health and wellness are driving this behavior change. Running for the reward of beer and hanging out is all well and good, researchers say, as long as people understand that lower-alcohol beer is only slightly better than its boozier cousins. But none of it is &quot;good&quot; for you. Tim Naimi is an alcohol researcher at Boston University and the Boston University Medical Center. Naimi said it's certainly better to drink lower-alcohol beer, but he pointed out what happens - especially after a race - is that people just tend to drink more of it, and often end up consuming the same amount of alcohol. If you want to drink alcohol, Naimi said, that's fine. Just don't pretend it's something that it isn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;img style='max-width: 345px;' src=&quot;https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1483/23949647672_701525ef36.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Davis then gradually removes that visual reinforcement by putting a curtain in front of the mirror. &Acirc;ìEventually, theyre doing it without any feedback at all,&Acirc;î she said. Her team has followed up with former subjects for up to 12 months, showing that they continued their improved gait. Researchers are able to study runners gaits with high-tech, 3-D imaging on &Acirc;ìthe worlds fanciest treadmill,&Acirc;î as Lieberman calls it, which sits atop a force plate that can measure and record the forces acting on a runners joints from all directions. But that technology does little to help the average marathoner looking to correct her form. Area runners can turn to Pierre DHemecourt, an HMS lecturer on orthopedic surgery and director of primary care sports medicine at Childrens Hospital Boston. DHemecourt oversees the Running Program at Childrens, a multidisciplinary clinic modeled on the University of California at San Franciscos RunSafe approach. The program, started two years ago, helps runners who want to improve their performance or prevent injuries. Patients meet with a four-person team that includes a physician, athletic trainer, dietitian, and podiatrist for an assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Women And Sport Today: Growth Statistics - Iberdrola]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The number of women who currently play sport or who closely follow sporting events is steadily increasing. The gap between men and women in sport has narrowed significantly over the last years. 261. Does this number mean anything to you? If the answer is no, read on. In 2018 it is common to see thousands of women competing in the world's great marathons, from New York to Berlin and Madrid. But this was not always the case. On 19 April 1967, Kathrine Switzer made history by circumventing the ban that prevented women from competing in a marathon. She also did this in the oldest marathon in the world - the Boston Marathon - and she did not just run it, she finished it with a time of 4 hours and 20 minutes despite the organisers' boycott. Kathrine herself remembers the event in an interview with the BBC: &quot;He grabbed me by the shoulders,&quot; she recalls, referring to Jock Stemple (co-director of the race), &quot;spun me back and started trying to rip off my bib numbers.&quot; Her bib number was 261 and ever since then it has been a symbol of equality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of women taking part in sport has only grown since then and the gap between men and women in their interest in sport has narrowed considerably over the last 50 years. This is one of the conclusions that can be taken from the latest Women and Sport report from Repucom (Nielsen, 2016). Sportswomen such as Yelena Isinbayeva, Serena Williams and Laure Manadou have taken the baton from pioneers such as Kathrine Switzer, Nadia Comaneci and Larissa Latynina and, nowadays, almost 50% of women worldwide are interested in sport. The mass media, first television and then the Internet, have brought sport closer to society, especially to women, as attendance at sporting events was long closed to them. But what sports do women watch on television? Their tastes differ depending on where they are from. In the United States American football reigns supreme, in the United Kingdom it's tennis, in China, badminton, in Japan ice skating, and in Mexico, football. In general, sports such as tennis, athletics or figure skating generate more interest among women than men. Motor sports, by contrast, are the least popular. Every story has its once upon a time, and this one starts in schools, because that is where the passion for sport is born. According to the Women and Sport report, women who participate in sporting activities at school have a 76% chance or remaining interested in sport for the rest of their lives. In the 1970s and 1980s girls' participation in these activities increased, and it has been these women who have turned the tables since then. And the trend will continue, because they are the ones now encouraging their daughters to play sports. Here, too, the differences between countries are considerable. In China only 14% of women between the ages of 16 and 29 did not play sports at school, a figure that contrasts with that of Japan, where up to 84% kept away from sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;img class='wp-post-image' src=&quot;https://rockytopsportsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Young-men-playing-lacrosse-1000x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Trends in Youth Sports Archives - Page 3 of 5 - Rocky Top ...&quot; style='max-width: 395px;'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;There are many reasons: playing sport in an uncontaminated place (for 48% of people interviewed), going away from crowded and noising places (23%), discovering local food and cuisine traditions, changing place every day, (15%), discovering local tradition and culture (11%). In general, in 2013, 21% of the Italian tourists who have chosen a green holiday in Italy have decided to spend their time trekking and biking. In the list of the green holidays top activities we find cycling holidays (chosen by 31% of the people interviewed), hiking (21%), trekking (15%) and animal watching (13%). In the list of the most appreciated activities we also find ski, horse riding, climbing and other sports. Cycling holidays and bike tours are becoming very popular because they give the opportunity to combine beautiful landscapes, culture, tradition, sport and food. Riding mountains by bike allow tourists to visit places and see landscapes by a different point of view. Biking means getting new places, fragrances, colors that you can't get travelling by car. But this is not all: Italy bike tours cancel the idea of &quot;destination&quot; to launch the concept of &quot;itinerary&quot; that can change everyday according to the different needs and athletic level of the tourists. According to this study, Italy bike tours mean sport and movement, but also new opportunities by the economic point of view. Green tourism in Italy (included cycling holidays, trekking and all the other activities) represents 12% of Gross National Product (GNP). Every cycling tourist in Italy spends about 500 euro (about 676 dollars) to buy local food, handicraft products and cycling parts. This framework should encourage local administrations and politic organizations to create new services for cycling tourists, to promote the different regions of Italy where tourist can play sports and spend their time, to build new infrastructures, cycling paths and other useful services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onesies have taken over the latest &lt;A href=&quot;https://floorball.sport/2018/04/16/floorball-is-on-the-programme-of-the-birmingham-world-games-2021-as-an-official-sport/&quot; &gt;world&lt;/A&gt; of fashion with rapid speed.

&lt;p&gt;James Smoliga is the author of that paper and a scientist who studies sports medicine at High Point University. He has studied 39 years of Nathan's Hot Dog Competition data that has him convinced that competitive eating is a sport, and it has room to get even more competitive. What makes competitive eating a sport - The Nathan's Hot Dog eating contest has followed a competitive trend-line that has defined many of our most physically taxing sports, from marathoning to the 100 meter. Smoliga. Then, as more people take up the sport, financial incentives increase or training becomes the norm, performance skyrockets before leveling off. When Smoliga looked for that pattern at the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, he found it. It even seemed to be progressing extremely quickly. The winning &quot;active consumption rate&quot; at the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest (how many grams one person can eat) has increased 700 percent in less than 40 years, Smoliga's paper notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, that's indicative of the fact that competitive hot dog eaters are treating themselves like athletes - they're training to win. In doing so, pushing the limits of human consumption ever upward towards the theoretical limit (84 hot dogs). The Michael Jordan of hot-dog eating - If we're talking about the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, the Michael Jordan is clear: Joey Chestnut has won every competition since 2007 except for the 2015 competition. He's also the world record holder: In 2020, he ate 75 hot dogs in 10 minutes. No hall of fame is complete without Takeru Kobayashi who doubled the world record in 2001 (He has since not appeared at the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest since 2009 reportedly due to conflicts with Major League Eating, the sport's governing body). On the women's side, Miki Sudo has been the Champion since 2014. She holds the women's world record of 48.5 hot dogs in 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/q4MsDcuppDw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen title='The summer of The Nexus: WWE Playlist'&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competitive eating is still so new - It's hard to know exactly what makes a champion (beyond a stretched stomach, which is the result of rigorous training). There is probably a size advantage - &quot;Big men seem to have dominated the early years of televised competition,&quot; a 2014 paper on competitive eating notes. However Kobayashi weighed in at only 105 pounds, was known for a rigorous bodybuilding routine, and &quot;distinctly professional push to competitive eating&quot; that paper notes. Physicality aside, the mental component perhaps sets competitors apart. The spirit of competitive eating - If anything has defined the past 39 years of the Nathan's Hot Dog eating contest, it's an astronomical rise from a silly festival game to a sport over a short period of time, going by Smoliga's research. But unlike some traditional sports, we're probably not anywhere near the limit of human performance in competitive eating. It's a controversial question, but there is mathematical evidence suggesting that the pace of world-record breaking does slow as we reach the true limit of biological human performance.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center; clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qKcxYt19nB8?showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;disablekb=1&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen title=&quot;2010 Volkswagen CC&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luxury transportation is admired by people all over the world. It's the wish of every person to hire luxury transportation for making his travels more comfortable and enjoyable. Similarly in the wealthiest state of the U.S, there is a trend of NJ Limo hire for attending special events and occasions. Limousines are the extraordinary vehicles which made exclusively for the corporate class people. They are very loaded with extreme features unlike any regular cars you will find around you. The word limousine does not specifically tell us about a car, instead it's a word which is used to categorize the corporate class vehicles with special amenities and features from the ordinary vehicles. There are many kinds of limousine vehicles which include sedan cars such as Mercedes Benz S Class, BMW 7 Series, Lincoln Town Car L Series and many more. The sedan limousines are cheapest of all, and then come the Sport Utility Vehicles which are also called SUVs. These vehicles are good for long tours and adventures as they are suitable for all kinds of terrains, rocky, hilly or deserts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have a highly comfortable seating capacity of up to eight people unlike sedans which can accommodate a maximum of three people. Aside from sedans and SUVs, the most expensive and extraordinary are the stretched limousines which are categorized into stretched sedans and stretched SUVs. The private car hire services can be found in all modern cities across the world, however in the state of New Jersey, the private car hire companies provide a diverse range of vehicles to choose from. You can choose to hire your favorite sports car, an economical sedan or a luxury limousine driven by a chauffeur as per your personalized requirements. These companies offer great prices for all kinds of private functions and party limousine transfers. Limousines are hired all over the world on weddings for transferring the couple from their private location to the venue and then to their private honeymoon place with utmost luxury and comfort. The limousines are decorated with flowers and ribbons in order to mark the difference between guests and the couple. A professionally trained chauffeur treats them like a celebrity and takes them to the venue with great style and class. Sporting events are held all over the world every years and the sporting fans always make sure that they do not miss the action live. They travel to far off cities and even countries for witnessing their favorite sporting events. In this regard, they spare huge amounts of money and make special preparations and arrangements. The trend of hiring a special sporting event limousine service is also very common among the sporting fans around the world. A chauffeur driven limousine service enables them to reach the event arena with complete comfort and within time. It makes sure that they won't miss a single action of their favorite game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once, big-name sponsorship deals were enough to satisfy sports marketers. But amid a saturation of advertising and proliferation of new channels, fresh opportunities are arising for brands and clubs alike to cultivate deeper relationships with fans. From women&acirc;Äôs leagues to AR and eSports, the sports marketing playbook is growing into a number of new arenas. Here The Drum charts some of the biggest trends in sports marketing for 2019 that brands should be aware of when entering or developing their work in the space. A Nielsen Sports report stated that 84% of general sports fans find women&acirc;Äôs sport more &acirc;Äúinspiring&acirc;Äù and &acirc;Äúprogressive&acirc;Äù than the male version, which is seen by many as being more &acirc;Äúmoney driven&acirc;Äù. These figures reveal the receptiveness of the public to women&acirc;Äôs sports and the opportunity it presents for sports marketers to explore. Phil Carling, head of global football at Octagon, touches on the significance of women&acirc;Äôs football in this changing landscape for advertisers: &acirc;ÄúConsumers want their brands to stand for something and equality, diversity and inclusion would rank highly in any list of causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brands are taking heed. Nike, for instance, put women&acirc;Äôs sport at the heart of its &acirc;ÄòDream Crazier&acirc;Äô campaign at the beginning of the year. Starring and narrated by tennis legend Serena Williams, the ad is an open call for women in sports to fight back against gender bias and unfair stereotyping. Its message resonated after the controversies that plagued Williams throughout 2018, including criticism of her Nike catsuit worn at the French Open and her hotly contested loss at the US Open final. The viral hit helped to drive conversation around leveling the playing field for women in sports. Regardless of the moral reasons for supporting women&acirc;Äôs sport, it makes commercial sense for brands to capitalize on the female consumer market. Currently in the UK, women are estimated to own half the personal wealth, a figure set to grow, and they are said to influence up to 80% of purchasing decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've got a fever, and the only prescription is more Olympics! It is time again for the greatest athletes in the world to compete on the world's biggest stage. The Olympics inspires all of us as it leaves us in awe of the talent and dedication put on display before our eyes in order to achieve the highest honor in athletics. No greater pride can be felt than when you are standing at the top of an Olympic podium, high above everyone else as the greatest of champions in your respective sport. To be awarded Olympic gold in an event you have dedicated years to perfect. And seeing your country's flag hoisted above all others as your national anthem gets blasted into the ears of an entire stadium, whether it is the familiar song they hoped to hear, or not. That precious moment all starts with one thing- precious metal. The Olympics are forever bonded to bronze, silver, and gold, but why? Each Olympic host creates their own custom medals, but have you ever wondered when this trend started?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you thought that the Olympics have always awarded medals, you are mistaken. While the first Olympics can be traced all the way back to 776 B.C, Olympic medals have only been awarded since 1896. The original Olympians kept it modest, wearing only the olive wreaths you still see on winners today. Alas, the vast majority of us are not cut out for Olympics greatness, but we can still cheer on. Thankfully, you don't have to be an Olympian to receive a medal. If you liked this report and you would like to get extra information about &lt;a href=&quot;https://alinea.mmtc.ac.id/&quot;&gt;trend sport world&lt;/a&gt; kindly go to our web site. Custom Medals are a common prize for many competitions, large and small. Wrestling tournaments, track meets, and even science fairs award their winners with a medal for their triumph. Medals are not known for holding monetary value. They are purely sentimental, but that is what adds to their charm. We never think of where our custom medals come from. All that matters is what that medal represents. Companies like Norco Incorporated are dedicated to providing custom medals that bring smiles to the faces of winners all over the country. While they leave the responsibility of Olympic medals for someone else, Norco proudly provides embroidered patches, enamel pins, and of course, custom medals. The beauty of the medal is in its sentimental value. When you win a medal for something you worked hard for, you'll see that you do not need an Olympic sized victory to get an Olympic sized feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

The brand itself goes back a few years but the collections keep the perfect balance between traditional choices and nonconformist expressions, marking huge sales. When you look at the evolution of the brand, its biggest advantage lies in its connection with the youth. Designs and collections are modified and updated on a regular basis so the brand can house products belonging to every new fashion trend. The scenario is also a representation of new age marketing that has been able to capture such a huge customer base. The original true religion jeans had the vintage 70s appeal and design, with straight and simple cuts that imposed a minimalistic yet definitive approach to fashion. The brand is a trend setter for many clothing lines, evolving the simple and rich fabric into a more Bohemian flair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style='clear:both; float:left; padding:10px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px; max-width: 315px;' class='wp-post-image' src=&quot;https://negativespace.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/negative-space-tennis-player-isabella-mendes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tennis Player&quot;&gt;If you are into the vintage look and feel, you can still pick up quality products across any modern line that keep the original elements intact. In fact, some collections have the vintage design presented in a more modern look to attract a new segment of customers.

It has become the talk of the town with elite parties and ramps sporting it as a part of their collections. There are two sides to its popularity and many are reluctant to embrace it but the contribution of leggings jeans to the world of fashion is irreplaceable. The name jeggings has been derived because it was originally used for jogging but it has now evolved into a premium fashion line of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can pick up zip or camouflage legging jeans that add a whole new charm to your wardrobe.

&lt;p&gt;Why sport world needs improvement from the blockchain world? It&acirc;Äôs not a secret that in the european football the overwhelming majority of clubs are subsidized by their owners. This trend is increasing every year - mainly this was the reason for the new policy of The UEFA that is called Financial Fair Play Regulations, due to which the expenses and incomes of clubs are now strictly controlled. But &acirc;ÄúPSG&acirc;Äù football club this summer proved that if you want, you can bypass this rule - according to the documents, Neimar was given hundreds of millions of dollars for the right to make him the face of the future World Cup in Qatar in 2022, and then he transferred most of the money to buy his contract from &acirc;ÄúBarcelona&acirc;Äù. As expected, it provoked a chain reaction - many coaches complained that now average players are several times more expensive than just a couple of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 times this summer. And this is only the beginning - in fact the same big clubs understand that they also need to spend as much as the &acirc;ÄúPSG&acirc;Äù and the &acirc;ÄúManchester City&acirc;Äù football clubs in order to play at the same level. We see the first results even now - the owner of &acirc;ÄúMilan&acirc;Äù FC is desperately looking for money, since he has already spent more than $250 million this summer. Thus, the expenses of clubs only grow each year, and even the owners of the most famous clubs in the world, such as &acirc;ÄúMilan&acirc;Äù FC, are looking for investors - and this gives great opportunities for our future platform. With our project you will be able to manage your favorite club not only in games, but also in real life.

The resulting chaos during Tuesday's primary elections in Georgia resulted in a national embarrassment and for the second time since 2018 raised questions about the state's ability to conduct fair elections. It also set off a scramble to identify and fix problems before the high-stakes November general election. Tuesday's breakdown drew the second round of stinging criticism for Georgia election officials since 2018, when the state's closely watched gubernatorial election was marred by hourslong waits at some polling sites, security breaches that exposed voter information and accusations that strict ID requirements and registration errors suppressed turnout. That led to lawsuits and changes to state law that included the $120 million switch to a new election system. Much of the outcry over the 2018 election targeted Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who still served as secretary of state when he ran for governor two years ago. Kemp has so far stayed silent on the most recent problems.&lt;/p&gt;

So how does a watch gradually become a necessary accessory for ladies? The decisive factors are the rarest materials and exceptional styles. We can see that the shape of a clock face has been changed a lot through years of improvement and innovation. At the very beginning, the shape is commonly made into a round circle without any embellishment, which looks very monotonous and stiff. Fashion watches However, with time passing by, the defects and roughness of ladies watches have been greatly improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://farm1.static.flickr.com/726/21805054436_4b20a7b85f.jpg&quot; class='wp-post-image' style=&quot;max-width: 370px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Now we don't have any difficulty in finding a special watch for ourselves, and clock faces are made with various patterns.

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Li Zhaohui&acirc;Äôs antics should have prepared me. I&acirc;Äôd lived in China for long enough that such hyperbole rarely phased me anymore, but the sharing meeting produced more histrionics than I&acirc;Äôd expected. In retrospect, I shouldn&acirc;Äôt have been surprised; running&acirc;Äôs grass roots craze was perfectly suited for the social-media-sharing obsession in China, which feels even more extreme than in the U.S. The meeting was simply a live version. Afterward, I spoke with a race organizer I&acirc;Äôd met in Tengchong. &acirc;ÄúSharing Meetings are a big new trend these days for running races,&acirc;Äù he explained, laughing at my bewilderment. Three days after the reunion, I met up with the Youji Running Group, named after an upstart running apparel company with a small outlet near the Central Business District. On warm days, as many as 60 runners show up to the shop. Thousands of similar groups meet around the city. Like most runners I&acirc;Äôd met in China, they were largely urban professionals, and few had been running for more than five years. The leader of the Youji group explained his decision to start running a few years prior by showing me an older photo of himself with a pot belly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump is planning to hold his first rally of the coronavirus era on June 19 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. And he says he&Acirc;&acute;s planning more events in Florida, Texas and Arizona as well. Trump made the announcement as he met with a handful of African American supporters Wednesday afternoon for a roundtable discussion. Trump's signature rallies often draw tens of thousands of people but have been on hiatus since March 2 because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has now killed more than 110,000 people in the U.S. Trump said during a White House event. The rally will take place on Juneteenth, the commemoration of the ending of slavery in the United States. Tulsa has its own troubling history on race. Its once-thriving African American business community was decimated in 1921, when a racist white mob killed hundreds of black residents.

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Shopping For Mens Stuff Over The Internet - Shopping]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The trend of online shopping started only a few years back, but even in this short span of time it has grabbed eyeballs of people from all corners of the world. What sets this format of shopping apart from the conventional method of shopping is the convenience that it offers to shop for just about anything. We men usually refrain from conventional shopping methods, mostly because we don't have that much that much patience to roam around on streets looking for stuff. Online shopping thus naturally comes to us as a boon to shop for all of our stuff easily and at much competitive prices. Electronics in what most of the men find most appealing to buy of everything else. Apart from electronics, apparels are what catch their attention the most. Shopping for men clothing online is an easy process in itself, for there lays a wide variety in all kinds of apparels in terms of sizes, designs, material they are made of, pricing and more. The trick here is to identify genuine stuff that is also quality-based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='https://media2.cgtrader.com/variants/WdeA6rhtPtCS2NtJVzJKANC8/9cae6891d5963582c5a024dd4cd2d77f44d540a2ca4f778b8c6afa6918049521/9.jpg' style=&quot;clear:both; float:right; padding:10px 0px 10px 10px; border:0px; max-width: 340px;&quot;&gt;Several online reviews available in different websites can provide a major help in this regard. Online shopping for men stuff is one trend that at times seems to outrun the trend of those for women. Many women at times refer to their men as lazy bone just because they don't prefer to accompany them outdoors. However when it comes to online shopping men mostly have an edge over their female counterparts. Over the last few years, the number of men shopping online has surged significantly and many surveys conducted from time to time prove just that. Men fashion too has surged significantly over the past several years. Online shopping is easily one of the prime reasons behind this surge. Accessibility of internet has made modern men aware of all the latest trends, which is why their demands in fashion has increased tremendously and so has the availability of options for them in terms of apparels as well as all associated accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of all the apparels, men prefer to buy Men T-shirts as well as Men jeans via online shopping. Both of these symbolize the generation of today, and so these two are mostly in demand among the youth. Older men buy these too because wearing these make them look younger. Internet gives them plenty of options in either of them, and the discounted prices compel all to go with them. As per a survey, it is also said that men are more likely to buy something that they find over the internet than buying it by walking into some retail store. Price tags and availability of so many choices are the major reasons behind this inclination of theirs. Apart from apparels, it is those elegant pair of shoes that make men go head over heels. Internet again offers a lot of variety in them, which compels a person to buy online shoes for men as soon as he sets his eyes on them. All kinds of footwear such as sport shoes, casual shoes, formal shoes, floaters and much more is available in abundance over the internet, and so men find no trouble in identifying the right pair for themselves. Several online stores of today also operate as exclusive stores, targeting only a particular segment of stuff. Thus, while there are several stores where you can find everything that you can seek for, there are other online stores too that offer only exclusive products, such as only shoes, only apparels, only accessories and so on. However, it is always recommended to a buyer that he seeks opinion from other buyers via forum or blogging websites as well, to determine the quality and worth of a particular online store so that he does not end up getting duped by buying something worthless over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of the app is to enhance the game you're watching on the field, said Chad Evans, senior vice president, product development, mobile at MLB. For advertisers and broadcasters, there are benefits too. Technology has already been trialled to personalize TV viewers&acirc;Äô experience of football games, most notably in 2018 when the FA and ITV ran a test during the England v Costa Rica friendly. Dynamic perimeter ads around the pitch were streamed to audiences based on location using Virtual Replacement Technology, allowing different viewers to see different ads. The ad offering was split into two feeds: one to the Americas, and the other to Asia, Australasia and parts of Europe. It is important that sports teams and athletes recognize the continued importance of social channels in building their fanbases and capitalizing on brand opportunities. Social channels like Instagram and Twitter present spaces where fan communities can be cultivated and maintained. This prime advertising space can also be used to present a humanized version of athletes and round-the-clock access to the sport.&lt;/p&gt;

Often these sessions are brand-sponsored. The North Face clothing brand is a prime example of how social sponsorship deals with athletes can help to promote its own products, while also supporting the work of the sports star. Prior to the release of the Oscar-winning 'Free Solo' documentary, The North Face Instagram page featured stories and content promoting the film and extreme rock climber Alex Honnold. These stories gave viewers exclusive insights on where they could watch the movie and insider information on the athlete. Much of The North Face social content is produced with the aim of supporting outdoor athletes, with its social content putting the experiences of the experts at the heart of the brand's campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Top 10 Reasons To Be Ethical And Live With Integrity]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='https://media3.cgtrader.com/variants/c2J5kq8LEQBY9d5MozqBuDe2/9cae6891d5963582c5a024dd4cd2d77f44d540a2ca4f778b8c6afa6918049521/render_06.jpg' style='clear:both; float:right; padding:10px 0px 10px 10px; border:0px; max-width: 380px;'&gt;Choosing to live ethically and with integrity isn't for the faint of heart. It means making choices and dealing with consequences that choosing to lie might help you avoid, at least in the short-term. Here are the top 10 reasons why it's worth the time and energy. 1. It's a great way to keep life simple. Life is complicated enough already, and it certainly seems like the trend is towards exponential complications in our society. Living with integrity is one way to keep it simplified. 2. Saves you time and energy. Fixing problems that can simply be avoided is an unfortunate waste of time and energy. If you're up to accomplishing big stuff in the world, this side effect of living ethically and integrously is one that you are going to have to leverage in your favor. 3. It's a small world after all. I live in bustling Miami, rubbing elbows on a regular basis with over six million people (between Dade and Broward Counties), and yet I am still constantly surprised at the ways I meet people again after not seeing them for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background:rgba(0,0,0,0.1);padding:0px 10px 1px 10px;border-radius:5px;border:1px solid #000;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ispo.com/en/trends&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The latest trends in the sports industry - ISPO.com&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;cite&gt;www.ispo.com&lt;span class=&quot;eipWBe&quot;&gt; &acirc;Ä&ordm; trends&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;color:rgba(0,0,0,0.6);&quot;&gt;For the first time, H&amp;M is collaborating with an all-female surf community, to help empower and inspire togetherness amongst women all over the &lt;em&gt;world&lt;/em&gt;. Teaming&lt;wbr&gt; ...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;clear:both; float:left; padding:10px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px; max-width: 380px;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.cgtrader.com/variants/w1Dbduk8qt9B1nLAqynUkipA/9cae6891d5963582c5a024dd4cd2d77f44d540a2ca4f778b8c6afa6918049521/cartoon-man-3d-model-low-poly-ma-mb-ztl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class='wp-post-image'&gt;As a trainer and a coach I've come to appreciate what a truly small world it is. Having always strived to treat people with honesty and to live with integrity it makes it a happy surprise to see them again. And because they're happy to see me too, it preserves my reputation in the circles of my new endeavors and I'm constantly rediscovering new warm market opportunities. 4. It keeps you from burning your bridges. When you live this way, you're not burning any bridges. It is a small world and you never know when you will find it useful to cross back across bridges you thought you were done with. 5. Life is a relationship game. Life is a team sport and the kind of team you have and the kinds of relationships you have with them is going to determine the boundaries of your success, and the level of integrity that you're living out of is going to have a direct impact on the kind of relationship that it is. 6. Your relationship with yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you consciously realize it not, being ethical and living life with integrity builds your self-esteem, your self-respect and your faith and trust in yourself. One of the most powerful tools we have for high powered living is our word. 7. It's using the Laws of Attraction. The underlying premise of the laws of attraction is about accomplishing more with less effort. Who wouldn't want more of that? 8. It makes you distinctive and special. If you're one of those people that thinks or says &quot;But everybody's doing it!&quot; - cutting corners, living in shades of grey, cheating on their taxes, whatever it is for you - then this one is especially for you. If everybody's doing it, doesn't being the one who says &quot;I won't&quot; really make you stand out from the crowd? 9. It makes you a role model. Whether you realize it or not, people are modeling their behavior after you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What kind of a role model do you want to be? 10. It helps to build a life worth living. Nobody has ever laid on their death bed and longed for the opportunity to go back and do it all over so they can lie to more people, steal more stuff, and to throw the people they love under the bus just one more time. Nor has anyone ever gone to their funeral and wished the same for them.

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Turf Seeds For All Your Sports]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;[English Y] Nuclear cooperation success for President Park in Vietnam etc. - &euml;èô&igrave;òÅ&igrave;ÉÅ&quot; src=&quot;http://image.rmcnmv.naver.net/news/2013/09/09/1679/031004231130532E4EC3398363C395D3184_muploader_m_270P_480_500_64_2_10.jpg&quot; class='wp-post-image' style=&quot;clear:both; float:right; padding:10px 0px 10px 10px; border:0px; max-width: 365px;&quot;&gt;Turf seeds, in general, are used for leisure, landscape, and sports, however, sports constitute the largest share of all the uses. Such seeds are used in a number of sports, be it cricket, golf, football, baseball, etc. There are various types of seeds, each suited for a different sport, for instance, the most preferred varieties for golf are Ryegrass, Creeping Bentgrass, Bermuda Grass, Zoysia Grass, etc. There are several types in the market, like Creeping Bent Grass, Blue Kentucky Grass, Tall Fescue Grass, Rye Grass, Bermuda Grass, Zoysia Grass, Bahia Grass, and others. Does this market for sports turf seed offer any benefits? The demand for them is a derived demand for turf-based sports fields, and with increasing number of tournaments, including the yearly Indian Premier League (IPL), the demand for it has been increasing rapidly over the years. However, with the growing trend of synthetic fields around the world, the growth of the market has somewhat slowed down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the scenario for such a niche market? What we are observing globally, in terms of sports turf seeds, is that the world trade of turf grass seed revolves around five major players. The United States is by far the largest producer and exporter of grass seed in the world. This is followed by the EU15 as a whole, then Canada and New Zealand follow. The other nations of significance in the market are Argentina and the Czech Republic. The main hurdles for the global turf seed market are; falling yield, rapid adoption of artificial turf, and rising costs of growing turf seeds. However, with increasing number of research studies ongoing for the development of drought tolerant and other types of turfs around the world. For instance, Grass Traits and Varieties (GTV) program represents research on a wide breadth of target traits for grass cultivars in the United Kingdom, it is expected that new and better varieties are likely to be developed in the future, which may further drive market growth.&lt;/p&gt;

Married men will never be grateful for how their wives can gather so many similar-looking shoes, when they only have two feet, but that is just the way the dissimilar genders are. Ladies like to look good, and that often involves appearing taller and stylish. Both of these can be achieved by wearing high heel shoes, which are documented by many dissimilar names and worn for more than a few unlike reason. Firstly, and probably most commonly, ladies wear high heel shoes to improve their confidence from side to side looks, wearing shoes with high heels can also create a better leg contour significant ladies calves. Of the many unlike kinds on the market, high heeled shoes are at present in the middle of worldwide market best for the stylish of shoes, some of which are worn to dinner, social proceedings or even stylish performances, with stripper shoes and tip shoes with money slots for added result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, there is a fast-growing market for extremity dance shoes and even pole dance lessons! Getting back to the theme of high heel shoes, there is some talk about as to when they were officially invented. This is because there is evidence of their use from as far back as ancient Egyptian times. However, in contemporary times, they probably started their rise to fame in the early to mid-sixteenth century and have grown in fame ever since. The likes of Marylyn Monroe and then Madonna in the 20th century and Lady Gaga in recent years have maintained the market for sexy-looking footwear to heighten one's appearance. For those wanting to look shockingly different high, high, high heels are available, but totally impractical to wear. Most ladies opt for items which look huge but can actually be walked in. Where to buy them is another thing to think. Being so tangible, and women often being so fickle, means that there will always be business for a real-world shoe shop. However, with the advent and huge growth of internet shopping, many ladies spend huge amount of time and money searching for cheap shoes online even if they don't actually purchase that many pairs. Common search phrases are heels online and cheap shoes online although additional exact searches, such as bridal shoes, flat shoes and high heels will produce more exact results. One thing that is seen as a market trend for the foreseeable future is the growing demand for ladies shoes, especially those which really improve their appearance or help them stand out from the crowd. Shopping online is growing earlier than many would realize but there will always be a place for the high street shoe shop.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[How Does TV And Film Shape What Consumers Buy?]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;clear:both; float:left; padding:10px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px; max-width: 310px;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.cgtrader.com/variants/JtvEHwnTaJxrNjGFcBpecxH6/9cae6891d5963582c5a024dd4cd2d77f44d540a2ca4f778b8c6afa6918049521/Diamond%20Cross%20Pendant%203.PNG&quot; class=&quot;wp-post-image&quot;&gt;Boyce, with the buzzer ball&acirc;Ä&brvbar; &acirc;Ä&brvbar;' that's a frequent sentence in my head in recent weeks, as I take my basketball down to a local court and play solo, as part of my commitment in lockdown to keep moving. The nudge to purchase a ball, walk five minutes to the hoops in my LA Clippers NBA top and pretend I'm in 1980s America - minus a boombox, friends, or an inch of coolness - was triggered by the Netflix documentary The Last Dance. And it appears I'm not alone: online marketplace eBay says there has been a 572 per cent annual increase in people looking to snap up a hoop and a similar rise in basketballs. It means that in the month after it first aired in April, every minute, someone put a basketball in their basket on eBay in Britain. The 10-part series filled many knowledge gaps for me: I was old enough to know about Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls at the time, but too young to fully digest the phenomena. It is a fantastic documentary even if you're not a basketball - or a sports - fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center; clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.cgtrader.com/variants/xRr2P4migzbBzmZ2bJdKEgCF/9cae6891d5963582c5a024dd4cd2d77f44d540a2ca4f778b8c6afa6918049521/0006.jpg&quot; style='max-width: 310px;'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;It's about the winning mentality, teamwork and the trappings of fame. It's got a terrific supporting cast of Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Steve Kerr and Phil Jackson, with even Chicago native Barack Obama popping up, along with Nas, Bill Clinton, Justin Timberlake and Carmen Electra: it's an eclectic mix which all adds to the narrative. Would you book a lockdown family photoshoot? I am a basketball fan. It is the only US sport I follow. But what the documentary got me thinking is: how do popular films and TV shows influence what we buy? I'm not talking about the adverts in between (a link which is being broken a little by streaming websites), but what actors or celebrities do, wear or say on screen. Murray Lambell, vice president of UK trading at eBay, tells me that it's an effect that has grown rapidly recently. He says: 'Over the past couple of years, we have seen that cult TV and film have a dramatic effect on the nation's buying habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe a large surge has also been created by 'dual-screening,' which I explain below. Sitting watching TV with a mobile shopping device next to you, probably helps with that. Did another Netflix smash Tiger King see you head online to buy outlandish animal print clothing? Did Connell's silver chain in BBC hit Normal People make you buy one? Consumer Trends takes a look&acirc;Ä&brvbar; After watching The Last Dance, which aired two episodes a week on Mondays in April and May, I was itching to throw a ball in a hoop. It's not a sport that comes naturally to me, but it's definitely a way to exercise solo. It happens with other sports. Wimbledon makes me go and play tennis. The &lt;a Href=&quot;https://www.theworldgames.org/sports/Air_Sports-29&quot;&gt;World&lt;/a&gt; Snooker Championship makes me go to the baize. The World Darts Championships out into my garage and onto the homemade oche. However, that is watching live sport - not a documentary. With the statistics from eBay mentioned above on buying hoops and balls, searches for Chicago Bulls jerseys actually saw the biggest annual increase of 604 per cent. There was one search every three minutes for 'Chicago Bulls jersey,' in April. It's no coincidence that the EU NBA store launched a Last Dance section of its website, where MJ23 tops cost as much as &Acirc;&pound;250, thanks to the interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But NASCAR has something else that other sports don't: an established online simulator that is already frequented by drivers and teams. That's how the eNASCAR iRacing Pro Invitational Series was born. NASCAR Managing Director of Gaming Scott Warfield told CBS Sports. Warfield explained further that NASCAR already had the eNASCAR Coca-Cola iRacing Series in place, a series that featured prominent NASCAR teams and online racers. He added that the team knew it would succeed on television because they had already aired the sim racing series championship last season. Denny Hamlin brought home the checkered flag. The immediate success was recognized across the sports community. During the race, the event was the top trend on Twitter. Just like that, NASCAR became the most-watched televised eSports program in history. It's not replacing the Cup Series, it's not replacing the NBA or any of this other stuff. We understand that. But it's filling a little bit of a void and it's real and it's dramatic and it's unpredictable and the finishes have been great.&lt;/p&gt;

Sports which grew and flourished in the nineteen twenties due to unprecedented publicity and promotion included baseball, tennis, golf, swimming, football and boxing. Newspapers, magazines, radio and movies all played a role in boosting the profile of sport and the sporting giants. The 1920's was a transition period for many sports. Sports that had up until that time been largely amateur events caught the eye of promoters who could see an opportunity to capitalize and make money. The professional football league, golf tours, and tennis circuit were organized. Media publicity ensured large crowds and guaranteed the financial success of the ventures, allowing new stadiums to be built and providing steadily increasing salaries for the sports stars. As people spent more time watching and listening (radio) to sport, they engaged in less sport themselves, a trend which has continued down to the present day resulting in the so-called &quot;couch-potato&quot; syndrome. Watching Babe Ruth play baseball became more important than playing baseball yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However this was not true of all sports, as tennis and golf in particular boomed due to their higher profile, and were popular with both men and women. Golf, as a sport, had been around for a relatively long time, but the 1920s saw a rapid rise in popularity so that by the end of the decade it was estimated that there were 3 million golfers playing in the U.S. 4,000 golf courses scattered around the country. In addition there were over 30,000 mini golf venues where the general public who couldn't afford the costs of equipment and club memberships could enjoy a much cheaper version of the sport. Money also became a factor in college sport where it was claimed that sports had also become commercialized to the point where the few were exploited to make a spectacle for the many and where the games became a source of financial revenue rather than a school of sport and exercise for the majority, and no longer focused on sportsmanship or moral development. The sports stars of this era remain well known even today, such was their fame and the publicity they received for their amazing careers, endorsements or promotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very few will not have heard of Babe Ruth in baseball, Jack Dempsey in boxing, Johnny Weissmuller in swimming, Knute Rockne and Red Grange in football, Bill Tilden and Helen Wills in tennis, and Bobby Jones, Walter Hagen and Glenna Collett in golf. As the current sports champions were coming to the close of their careers a younger generation of sports stars were in the making. The momentum these sports built up in the 1920's has ensured that these sports have endured in popularity to the present day. Present day sporting stars are often compared to the greats of the 1920's and great publicity attends the player who exceeds the records set 80 years ago, ensuring our old heroes are not forgotten. Pilgrimages are made to the various halls of fame where the 1920's giants are immortalized in memorials and collections of memorabilia that showcase their careers. 1927 in sports - First Ryder Cup of golf - Samuel Ryder presented the Ryder Cup as a prize at the first international competition between U.S. 1928 in sports - Women's Olympic athletics and gymnastics are held for the first time at the 1928 Summer Olympics; &quot;Dixie&quot; Dean scores 60 league goals in 39 matches as Everton F.C. Gate receipts for the ten biggest football clubs increased throughout the 1920's until the depression hit when takings of less than $2,000,000 in 1931 were lower than in 1925. Indoor games that could be played at home suddenly increased in popularity - games like table tennis, quoits, dominoes, chess, backgammon, and checkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our forte is building products that deliver a fantastic experience but at a retail price point that consumers can get behind. According to Hannon, user-friendly, easily installable and plug-and-play units hold special appeal for UTV consumers. Among Boss Audio&acirc;Äôs most popular products is a sound bar featuring Bluetooth and auxiliary and USB inputs that retails for $199. &acirc;ÄúWe also have products such as the MVG550B, which is not as plug-and-play but does have a 5-in. touchscreen for the dash with a camera input,&acirc;Äù he said. Ultimately, experts agree that overall growth in the powersports category shows little sign of abating anytime soon. When retailing parts and accessories for motorcycles or UTVs, the main strategies for winning over consumers start with showing an understanding of the market. As Hannon summed up, &acirc;ÄúThe biggest thing you can do is make sure you have product on hand and on display and possibly have a vehicle and be part of the community, because it really is a community. And each community has a location where they go to ride, who they go to after the ride, who does the work on their vehicles and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents of high school students like it as a way to enhance their child&acirc;Äôs skill as well as keep them involved with sports. These technology-driven businesses are the kind of companies that are now driving the fitness business. Consumers interest in new fitness technology coupled with the continued desire for gyms is clearly how consumers want to manage their own fitness. Whether gyms and studios can keep up with the desire for new technology will determine their future success. Karmitz says that data gathering is one of the economic drivers of new technology in fitness and gyms as we are already seeing in the acquisition of Fitbit by Google and that there will be more such deals. Karmitz points out that having Google enter the industry proves that big tech companies want to be players in the industry, won&acirc;Äôt be afraid to invest big money and will push valuations up. She says the market now is in a land-grab mode, companies that can get on a path to gather consumer data and sell their technology profitably will be highly valuable in the future. That means timing is important now in the fitness business. No one knows how long this trend will last and companies that can embed their technology into consumer habits and gain share will become highly valuable. Their investors will be able to exit at very attractive multiples. Companies that don&acirc;Äôt have the resources to grow now may miss the trend. As a result, we are likely to see a lot of technology innovation in the fitness and gym industry as well as a great deal of capital coming into the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Team And Individual Sports Are An Important Component Of A Girls Fine Arts Camp Program]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;clear:both; float:right; padding:10px 0px 10px 10px; border:0px; max-width: 315px;&quot; src='https://media2.cgtrader.com/variants/hKtb9rBubZ3BgjuhXagV8SHz/9cae6891d5963582c5a024dd4cd2d77f44d540a2ca4f778b8c6afa6918049521/11%20-%20Copy.jpg' class='wp-post-image'&gt;Virtually all children are born with an innate creative bent; from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tokopedia.com/onilneshop/jam-tangan-seiko-5-srp127k1-sport-world-time-silver-black-original&quot;&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; little artists learn to color inside the lines and tiny ballerinas choose the music to accompany their first dance steps, they all want to do something to express themselves. Those who are encouraged will often go on to develop real talents in those pursuits. It is not unusual for little girls to dream of fame and fortune as artistes much like those idols they are emulating. Parents can help these girls really hone their talents, and take a peek into the real world at the same time, by sending them to an art camp or summer music camp. While fine arts camps have been around for years, there is a more recent trend to incorporate both individual and team sports into the regularly scheduled activities. The fact is, whether the camper is only 8 years old or 18, it&acirc;Äôs very important to remain physically active. This is especially true for those in the more sedentary groups, such as painting, acting, jewelry making and other programs that require little movement. Those whose interest lies in dance also need sports to round out their lives, for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, most individual activities such as archery, canoeing, swimming, tennis and riding use different muscles, or use them differently, than those used in dance. Participating in other physical activities can help these youngsters improve balance, coordination and breath control. More importantly, however, outdoor sporting activities get the girls out into the fresh air, and provide both fun and opportunities for interacting with others outside their particular focus group who they might not otherwise befriend. Aside from expanding their areas of expertise in their chosen field, girls are encouraged to join teams of competitive sports such as volleyball, basketball, softball and soccer. Team sports not only encourage a sense of camaraderie, but give girls a taste of competition. Learning to both win and lose with grace is a skill that carries over into many life situations, and can be particularly helpful when seeking work in their chosen professions. Actors, dancers, musicians and other artists are constantly exposed to rejection, so understanding and accepting the competitive nature of these occupations, and life in general is an important life lesson, and part of the maturing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dealing with the competition while playing a team sport teaches invaluable life lessons that will stand youngsters in good stead throughout their lives. After spending the summer at an art camp or summer music camp that includes sports and athletics, the return to the school year often becomes more rewarding. Exposure to team games and individual sports during the summer often helps these girls gain a new level of self confidence which can expand horizons and open doors to scores of new friends and activities during the school year. An interesting observation is that more than one girl has gone to an art camp to improve her acting or musical abilities only to find herself falling in love with horses and becoming an avid rider. At least one dancer became entranced with synchronized swimming and eventually joined a professional troupe of water performers. Camps are more and more offering the most rounded approach to life and career pursuits that they can handle, which is always beneficial to the girls fortunate enough to spend a summer at one of these facilities. If you are looking for a premier summer music camp author Stephen Daniels suggests you check out Belvoir Terrace. They offer a diverse program and talented, experienced coaches. This is a fine arts camp that also offers individual and team sports activities too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terry Wallace was a himself star player throughout the 1980s, before coaching for more than a decade with the Western Bulldogs and Richmond. He knows all too well the stress that comes with managing massive teams of athletes - many with large egos - particularly with sport now a multi-million dollar business. In a Twitter post on Monday night he outlined his concerns about the number of top coaches who have made headlines for all the wrong reasons in recent years. I'm really seriously disturbed by the fallout and trend of major issues surrounding our past senior AFL Coaches in the last decade,' Wallace, 61, wrote. There are only 18 coaching at one time yet they are outweighing player issues. As a matter of urgency we need to ask why this has occurred? Tragedy struck the AFL community last September with the death of Danny Frawley, a champion player, coach and commentator. Frawley, 56, was involved in a fatal single car crash after a long and very public battle with mental health issues. A day before his death Frawley was due to attend his own birthday celebration, but never showed. In the months leading up to his death the much-loved football personality struggled to come to terms with the collapse of his marriage and a business deal gone wrong. After the tragic crash, Frawley's best friend and AFL legend Jason Dunstall told how despite always checking in on his mate he wished he could have done more. I'd make a point of asking him every now and then: ''How are you going? Until you get to the stage of feeling like you're bugging him so you stop asking,' Dunstall said. I have seen something or should I have noticed something?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&acirc;Äôs impossible to read Jelena Dokic&acirc;Äôs and other sport stars&acirc;Äô stories of physical, emotional and verbal abuse suffered at the hands of their parents or coaches without being horrified. It&acirc;Äôs also easy to blame controlling sport parents like Dokic&acirc;Äôs father, but by doing this we&acirc;Äôre ignoring a much larger problem. Child and adolescent sport at an elite level can mirror child labour, so the sport itself should be treated with same degree of scrutiny. Canadian sport sociologist Peter Donnelly noticed a trend in sports 20 years ago: children were encouraged to participate heavily at a younger and younger age. This was spurred on by parents and the sport talent identification system. Children dedicated greater time and commitment to training and competition under stress from poor behaviour by parents, coaches and administrators. At the time, Donnelly argued that the conditions of some elite child athlete programs bore a striking similarity to child labour conditions. He argued national laws against child labour should be applied in the elite sport context.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Slater Confirms &Acirc;&pound;1.75m-a-year Presenter Gary Lineker Has Job For Life]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;clear:both; float:left; padding:10px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px; max-width: 300px;&quot; src='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pjmYB3cqY08/hqdefault.jpg' alt='2017 Ford F150 XLT Sport Pkg. Truck Review Super Crew V8 4X4 - Box Link - Trailer - Sync 3 - &euml;èô&igrave;òÅ&igrave;ÉÅ'&gt;Gary Lineker will host the BBC&acirc;Äôs first live Premier League game on Saturday - after being promised the Match of the Day hotseat is his for as long as he likes. And in a rare interview to mark the occasion, Barbara Slater, the director of BBC Sport, has lauded the long-serving Lineker, who is the corporation&acirc;Äôs best-paid presenter, earning &Acirc;&pound;1.75million last year. Asked if she expected him to remain as Match of the Day&acirc;Äôs anchor for many years to come, Slater told Sportsmail: &acirc;ÄòFrom our point of view, yes we do. Quite frankly, he is the best in the business and he is a fantastic asset to this organisation and long may he continue to present Match of the Day. Lineker will present Saturday&acirc;Äôs 7.45pm kick-off from the BBC&acirc;Äôs Salford studio, alongside pundits Alan Shearer and Ian Wright, with Steve Wilson and Jermaine Jenas the commentary team at the Vitality Stadium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-post-image&quot; src=&quot;https://media2.picsearch.com/is?W5vEHlw4fhyqgz8EozGuZxyTkXvPzze1ClrG7PWdfrM&amp;width=1214&quot; alt=&quot;www.chapssports1.com&quot; style='clear:both; float:left; padding:10px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px; max-width: 300px;' /&gt;The ordinarily low-key fixture is tipped to become the most watched Premier League game in UK television history, beating the record set in 2012, when four million viewers saw the Manchester derby on Sky Sports. As part of the Government&acirc;Äôs demand for a third of the remaining top-flight games to be shown free-to-air, the Beeb will also broadcast Norwich against Everton on Wednesday, Manchester City&acirc;Äôs visit to Southampton on July 5 and one other, as yet undecided, match. In her 11 years as BBC Sport&acirc;Äôs boss, this is one rights agreement Slater never expected. &acirc;ÄòWe wish we weren&acirc;Äôt in these circumstances but it&acirc;Äôs a wonderful opportunity to bring top-flight football to the widest possible audience,&acirc;Äô said Slater, who revealed there could also be as many as four Match of the Day highlights programmes on a week. &acirc;ÄòIt is something that is very special. With no fans to generate an atmosphere, the contentious decision has been taken to use fake crowd noise on the BBC One broadcast, with viewers having to use the red button to be able to watch with the natural sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&acirc;ÄòWe decided to make a really late call on this,&acirc;Äô said Slater. If fans are still not allowed into stadiums at the start of next season, there have been calls for the BBC to be offered more live Premier League matches, something Sky Sports and BT Sport will resist. Top-flight football&acirc;Äôs return - albeit temporary - to terrestrial TV bucks the trend of Slater&acirc;Äôs time in charge, when the BBC has lost many sporting events to subscription channels. As a former golf producer, she is saddened the Beeb no longer have live rights to any of the sport&acirc;Äôs four majors. &acirc;ÄòWe are worried about it all,&acirc;Äô Slater replied when asked if she feared losing the rugby union tournament. &acirc;ÄòThat process is paused so I probably shouldn&acirc;Äôt talk about a live negotiation, but it is incredibly competitive. These are premium rights. &acirc;ÄòWe know that and we try to beat the drum around our reach as loudly as we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&acirc;Äôt deny the BBC&acirc;Äôs ability around reach and it is something we are always telling governing bodies in any negotiation, we bring those numbers to the table. &acirc;ÄòWe would love to maintain everything we do, but I think there is a cycle and sometimes you lose. There is a reason a sport goes one way and I am really proud the FA Cup and cricket have come back. &acirc;ÄòWe can&acirc;Äôt afford everything, we&acirc;Äôve had to make choices. We are going to do our best with the resources that we have to secure the best possible portfolio that we can and inevitably that will change over time. &acirc;ÄòBut if you were to look at our investment in sports rights, I think you can say we punch above our weight. The BBC&acirc;Äôs reach has never been more apparent than last year&acirc;Äôs Women&acirc;Äôs World Cup, when a peak audience of 11.7million watched England&acirc;Äôs semi-final defeat to USA. Slater has been instrumental in promoting women&acirc;Äôs sport and says the BBC&acirc;Äôs commitment to cover it &acirc;Äòis not going to wane&acirc;Äô despite the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former British gymnast has also overseen a controversial changing of the guard of Beeb broadcasters, with many much-loved and experienced voices making way for younger talent. Commentator Alan Green said he was shown &acirc;Äòvery little respect&acirc;Äô when he was told his contract was not being renewed this summer, while the likes of presenter Mark Pougatch, cricket commentator Geoff Boycott and horse racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght have also been shown the door. &acirc;ÄòThings evolve, it changes over time,&acirc;Äô said Slater. &acirc;ÄòThere can be so many individual reasons (for people leaving). Financially we might choose to deprioritise a sport in comparison with the past. Sometimes it is because those people make those choices of their own. We also have many occasions when they get opportunities elsewhere and then availability isn&acirc;Äôt the same. &acirc;ÄòThere are a raft of reasons but fundamentally I think it is right that as a business that is ambitious for the future we are bringing in new talent.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[The First Decade Of Mr Olympia Title]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The genesis of the Mr. Olympia title can be traced to 1963, when Joe Weider first expressed the need for a bodybuilding title that could propel the sport to the next level. The Mr. America, Mr. World and Mr. Universe titles had become far too low to host the new generation of body builders. It was the 1965 Mr. Olympia title that finally emerged as the ultimate contest with highest prize for the greatest physique in the globe. On its inaugural contest held at Brooklyn Academy of Music, the title took professional bodybuilding to unexplored heights. On September 18, 1965, Larry Scott the bodybuilding Legend took the crown as the predecessor of a truly trend-setting decade. Having worn the Mr. America, Mr. World and Mr. Universe titles, Scott took the first title as a crown to a life well lived. He went on to win the 1966 contest before announcing his retirement for the pro scene. That created room for Sergio Oliva, The Myth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/jb4eluvTO_o?showinfo=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen title=&quot;THE FASTEST ELECTRIC CARS In The&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was Oliva who won that third contest in 1967. He was so big, so amazing that, he contested and won the 1968 Mr. Olympia contest unchallenged. In 1969, Olivia faced his greatest challenge, which was to brew into the greatest contest rivalry in the American history of professional bodybuilding. A very young Austrian, Arnold Schwarzenegger, debuted in the Mr. Olympia contest but lost in a closely contested battle. Olivia was the first Mr. Olympia champion to take home the trophy for three consecutive years. But in 1970, Arnold stopped Olivia short to become the third body builder to take the Olympia title. Arnold was to perform even better than his predecessors. He was unopposed in the 1971 Mr. Olympia contest held at Paris. This was the year that the contest was held anywhere outside New York. For the 1972 edition, he Mr. Olympia title was held in Essen, Germany. It was here that Arnold put to rest the battle between him and Olivia, by winning the trophy in a very close race determined by a four to three judges' vote. Back again to New York, the 1973 Championship became Arnold's fourth consecutive title, a record but an easy win by all measures. In 1974 however, Lou Ferrigno made his debut on the New York edition, at Madison Square Garden. Arnold broke his record again and bagged the fifth Olympia title. He was not yet done since, when the Mr. Olympia title was held in South Africa for the 1975 edition, he still won and immediately retired. The 1975 Mr. Olympia title was the first to be filmed and preserved in Pumping Iron. The 1976 Olympia contest was held moved to Columbus, Ohio, promoted by Arnold and Jim Lorimer. It was here that Franco Columbu won the Olympia title five appearances. After the win, he announced his retirement and gave Frank Zane, his greatest competitor in the 1976 contest, the leeway to win the 1977 Mr. Olympia title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told Rooty I could still feel the side but that I could play if he wanted me to. I left it to them and if Jofra Archer had been fine I don&acirc;Äôt think I would have played but because he wasn&acirc;Äôt great either I played. It was gutsy from them to pick me and now I&acirc;Äôm pleased it went that way. Nasser: That was the last Test England played. Now, maybe, just maybe, the next will be at the Ageas Bowl on July 8. As opposed to football where some players seem worried about returning, cricketers appear to be as one and want to get on with it. Is that how you see it? Wood: Yes and no. Football is different. We&acirc;Äôre not in a contact sport. I really trust the team doctor. It&acirc;Äôs like when we went to Bangladesh and all the talk was security issues. We trusted our security guy who we knew really well and this time we trust the doctor (Nick Peirce). No stone has been left unturned and there are constant updates from him and Ashley Giles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lads have asked hard questions about time away, coming in and out of the &acirc;Äòbubble&acirc;Äô and getting physio treatment, the standard of play and the lack of crowds. It&acirc;Äôs not like we&acirc;Äôve just accepted it, but the general feeling has been positive. It is divided because it&acirc;Äôs such a sensitive issue but the lads are keen to get back out there. The training so far has been good and as long as we keep on that trend it should be all right. Nasser: Are the team across all the bio-secure arrangements? Do they know exactly what they are signing up for? Wood: Yes and you have to opt into that. Legally you have to say so. The lads who are training at the moment have all opted in, as have the physios and coaches. From my point of view going into an environment that will be clean, where everyone is tested, will be like going into a family where everyone is locked down. It will be like being on tour in a place where it&acirc;Äôs hard to go out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wei Jun still believed the only way to make money was to win a contract, but even making money after that was hard; hosting races required a lot of legwork in China, where going through the approval process from local authorities is much more involved than in the United States. &acirc;ÄúIt&acirc;Äôs not like in the U.S., where a bunch of friends will just say, &acirc;ÄòHey, let&acirc;Äôs get a few volunteers together and have a race this weekend,&acirc;Äô&acirc;Äù one of Sanfo&acirc;Äôs race organizers, who went to grad school in Arizona, told me. In China, expenses tend to add up quickly. In 10 years, Wei Jun expected only about 10 percent of race organizers to still be around. When I asked if a bubble burst meant there would be fewer races-and perhaps fewer runners-he hesitated. &acirc;ÄúMaybe, but not that much less,&acirc;Äù he said. &acirc;ÄúYou know China, it&acirc;Äôs big-they&acirc;Äôll just be a new wave of companies to come in and replace them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then they&acirc;Äôll go bankrupt a few years later. Then new ones will come in. It&acirc;Äôs a cycle.&acirc;Äù Holes in the bubble would pop only so briefly before being plugged by someone else. Zuiku&acirc;Äôs own office spoke to those challenges. It was cramped with 11 employees. But next door there was another startup, which was building shower stations for runners in Beijing&acirc;Äôs Olympic Forest Park, the city&acirc;Äôs most popular place to log miles. Yu Lanjiang thought they were probably making money. &acirc;ÄúHow about Zuiku?&acirc;Äù I asked founder Yu Lanjiang. &acirc;ÄúStill not making money. Hopefully we&acirc;Äôre close, though,&acirc;Äù he said, shaking his head. The way the race organizers spoke of China&acirc;Äôs running boom shared nearly every defining eccentricity of China&acirc;Äôs modern economy, political system, and cultural ticks. There was that odd combination of an enormous emerging market-the huge supply of runners-with its commercial derivatives, along with government intervention for political purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Life In Olympics &amp; The Value Of Medals In Podium Ceremony - Sports]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;It is time again for the greatest athletes in the world to compete on the world's biggest stage. The Olympics inspires all of us as it leaves us in awe of the talent and dedication put on display before our eyes in order to achieve the highest honor in athletics. No greater pride can be felt than when you are standing at the top of an Olympic Award Podium , high above everyone else as the greatest of champions in your respective sport. To be awarded Olympic gold in an event you have dedicated years to perfect. And seeing your country's flag hoisted above all others as your national anthem gets blasted into the ears of an entire stadium, whether it is the familiar song they hoped to hear, or not. That precious moment all starts with one thing- precious metal. The Olympics are forever bonded to bronze, silver, and gold. Each Olympic host creates their own custom medals, but have you ever wondered when this trend started. If you thought that the Olympics have always awarded medals, you are mistaken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ArfnL1G-kcg?modestbranding=1&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen title=&quot;2010 Volkswagen CC&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the first Olympics can be traced all the way back to 776 B.C, Olympic medals have only been awarded since 1896. The original Olympians kept it modest, wearing only the olive wreaths you still see on winners today on Podium Ceremony . Alas, the vast majority of us are not cut out for Olympics greatness, but we can still cheer on. Thankfully, you don't have to be an Olympian to receive a medal. What is the Value of Medals? Custom Medals are a common prize for many competitions, large and small. Wrestling tournaments, track meets, and even science fairs award their winners with a medal for their triumph. Medals are not known for holding monetary value. They are purely sentimental, but that is what adds to their charm. We never think of where our custom medals come from. All that matters is what that medal represents. There are many companies that are dedicated in providing custom medals that bring smiles to the faces of winners on Award Podium all over the country. When you win a medal for something you worked hard for, you'll see that you do not need an Olympic sized victory to get an Olympic sized feeling. Now it's show time! All eyes are on you. It's time to raise some excitement. It's time to make a special person feel like they are the most important person in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://floorball.sport/2018/04/16/floorball-is-on-the-programme-of-the-birmingham-world-games-2021-as-an-official-sport/&quot;&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;, at least for the next few moments. You have your script. If it is a trophy, plaque or an object of some kind, this would be a good time to show it to the audience. Well, maybe in your mind! Your role at this point is to act as a cheerleader and lead the applause as you announce the winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also rivals if not outpaces Lieberman in her enthusiasm for barefoot running. Lieberman, whose 2010 Nature cover article on barefoot running received a flood of attention, calls Davis hiring a coup for Harvard. &Acirc;ìWe came into the world barefoot,&Acirc;î Davis said. And until the 1970s, she said, running shoes were much more minimal than were used to today. &Acirc;ìThey had a surface that protected the bottom of your foot and something that kept it on,&Acirc;î she said. The problem with shoes is they allow runners to strike the ground with their heels, rather than their mid- or forefoot. &Acirc;ìWhen you put a foot into a cushioned shoe, you land harder, and more on your heel,&Acirc;î Davis said. &Acirc;ìWhen you take your shoes off, you run differently.&Acirc;î Three out of four shod runners land on their heels, according to Davis, while nearly every barefoot runner lands on the balls of his feet. &Acirc;ìWhen you heel strike, what happens, from a biochemical standpoint, is that you get this big, quick rise-to-peak in the force that your body experiences,&Acirc;î she continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiplied over the thousands of strides runners make, that repeated trauma can lead to a host of injuries. Liebermans Skeletal Bio Lab spent four years studying the Harvard track team for insights into how a runners strike correlates with injury rates and published results online last month in Medicine &amp; Science in Sport &amp; Exercise. All of the runners in the study were shod, but 31 percent were natural forefoot strikers. &Acirc;ìWe showed that members of the track team who habitually run with a forefoot strike have less than half the injury rate of the ones who rear-foot strike,&Acirc;î Lieberman said. Still, Lieberman is quick to point out that theres no one catchall solution, and adds that people who rear-foot strike shouldnt necessarily switch their gait, especially if they are uninjured. Nor should a runner ever attempt to switch his gait overnight. Lieberman emphasized that there were plenty of forefoot strikers in the study who still suffered injuries, and there were some rear-foot strikers who did not. &Acirc;ìThere are no simple answers, none,&Acirc;î Lieberman said. But there have been anecdotal success stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garber was one runner who benefited from a change in form rather than in shoe. When he returned to Harvard, he met Lieberman, and the two became running buddies. Lieberman pointed out that Garber was overstriding and leaning too far forward as he ran. &Acirc;ìI was also sure that I was landing on my mid-foot or forefoot, and he was convinced I was landing on my heel,&Acirc;î Garber said. Since Garber has started practicing drills to improve his form, hes been able to run with less pain &Acirc;ó a trend he hopes will last through the upcoming marathon battle with Heartbreak Hill. Davis believes that many runners with problems can be retrained. At the SNRCs clinic, she and her associates put them on treadmills in front of mirrors, allowing them to watch themselves move. When runners can see, for example, how their knees cave inward as they stride &Acirc;ó &Acirc;ìthe egg-beater gait,&Acirc;î in Davis words &Acirc;ó they can compensate more easily.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Tibet's Only Football Club Folds Over Altitude Row]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-post-image&quot; src=&quot;https://storage.cgtrader.com/rails/active_storage/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBMTBFSGc9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e64b66987a80c80e20ae7dc6f9c5290492248971/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdCam9VWTI5dFltbHVaVjl2Y0hScGIyNXpld282QzNKbGMybDZaVWtpRFRZM05uZzFNREErQmpvR1JVWTZER2R5WVhacGRIazZDMk5sYm5SbGNqb01kVzV6YUdGeWNFa2lFakl1Tkhnd0xqUXJNUzQzS3pBR093ZFVPZzVwYm5SbGNteGhZMlZKSWdwUWJHRnVaUVk3QjFRNkRIRjFZV3hwZEhscFdnPT0iLCJleHAiOm51bGwsInB1ciI6InZhcmlhdGlvbiJ9fQ==--623c6a310f0f834f948241cae8d918ff137f5aa9/bed-trend-capo-dopera-3d-model-max-obj-3ds-fbx-mtl.jpg&quot; style='clear:both; float:right; padding:10px 0px 10px 10px; border:0px; max-width: 375px;' /&gt;Tibet's first and only professional football team has become the latest in a string of Chinese clubs to fold, following a row over hosting matches in one of the highest cities in the world. Lhasa Chengtou played only two games in the Tibetan capital -- which sits at an oxygen-sucking altitude of 3,650 metres (12,000 feet) -- and on both occasions the referee had to suspend play every 15 minutes to let the players breathe bottled oxygen, Xinhua news agency said. The demise of the club, just three years after it was founded, is a blow to the ruling Communist Party's hopes of having a team in the professional leagues to make Tibetans feel more integrated into China. Lhasa Chengtou finished last season 26th of 32 teams in China's third division and had been playing their home matches thousands of kilometres (miles) away. Twitter-like Weibo to its 2,500 followers, announcing its closure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team has been training and hosting matches in other parts of China and was desperate to get back to Tibet, but the Chinese Football Association reportedly would not sanction games at high altitude over concerns for player safety. There were claims that during one match in Lhasa, six players from visiting Shenzhen Pengcheng had to be stretchered off with altitude sickness. That was denied by Tibetan police. The club said the other reason for its dissolution were CFA rules banning corporate names. The team was also known as Lhasa Urban Construction Investment, after a major state-owned company in Tibet. Last week, Lhasa Chengtou said it was letting all its coaches, players and staff go. Since the club was established, the team played only five matches in Tibet and instead staged games last year in Deyang, Sichuan province, more than 2,400 kilometres from Lhasa, the Global Times said. The fate of the club's youth players was unclear, but the Global Times said last week that more than 70 youngsters aged 13 to 16 -- all Tibetan -- were training in Lhasa despite the punishing conditions and the team's imminent demise. Although Lhasa Chengtou were only formed in 2017, initially in the amateur league, football has a long history in Tibet after it arrived in the remote region with the British army at the beginning of the 20th century. Lhasa Chengtou are the 17th club to depart Chinese professional football this year, Global Times said, a trend that is undermining China's efforts to become a superpower in the sport. The financial problems of cash-strapped clubs have been exacerbated by the coronavirus, which has indefinitely delayed the Chinese football season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The financial pressure on clubs would ease dramatically, they would still be able to field their best XV in the marquee matches and the salary cap could be reduced. The lockdown is making many scenarios appear worth considering, so how about this one? Any plans for a new season structure will be up against a tendency for all parties to protect their patch. That much was highlighted last week when Simon Halliday, chairman of European club tournament organisers EPCR, warned World Rugby that they would not surrender October - if rugby is playable by then - for national teams to fulfil postponed Tests. Their concern about a lack of consultation is understandable, but it is inevitable that if the game is operational by the autumn, international rugby must take priority because it generates the most revenue. However, in this case it must be shared around, between unions and clubs. It is likely the Six Nations will be concluded &lt;a href='https://www.roundhillinvestments.com/research/esports/esports-viewership-vs-sports'&gt;in&lt;/a&gt; October and July tours will also be deferred to that month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funds must trickle down to the clubs to alleviate their losses. Australian rugby is in dire trouble. After 11 former Wallaby captains wrote a letter calling for the overhaul of the national union's hierarchy, one of them, Michael Lynagh, distanced himself from the group publicly. Within days, Rugby Australia's chief executive Raelene Castle had left her post and the Kiwi's departure - after a bitter campaign against her - led the New Zealand Rugby Union to wade in with a statement of support for their compatriot's work. Whoever takes charge of the 15-man code in Australia must be clear about the predicament the sport faces. Rugby league is more popular, cricket has a nationwide reach, Aussie Rules has its heartlands and 'soccer' has risen to prominence. So without unity and smart crisis management, rugby union in Australia is staring at oblivion. Here's a request for all those officials voting for the next World Rugby chairman. Get on with it. It is a simple process, so any stalling would leave this open to pressure being applied to late voters. Bill Beaumont's supporters are convinced he has managed to fend off Agustin Pichot to earn a second term in the post, despite indications that there may not be as much unity within the Six Nations bloc as they privately claim. The contest appeared to be on a knife-edge as the ballot opened on Sunday night, but there is every chance that all the votes will be in by this evening - so why must we wait until May 12 to discover the result? English Rugby is boring!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is Sports Tourism&acirc;Äôs connection with Wellness? Sports events are becoming a major driver of economic development globally. Global management consultants, AT Kearney, have estimated that the industry is worth around USD 620 billion. That figure represents a significant portion of the USD 4.5 trillion estimated value of the tourism industry as a whole. Sports tourism is a viable pathway for generating visitor spending and promoting a destination&acirc;Äôs local attractions and outlying districts. Aside from the obvious and vast benefits of travel, sports tourism is great for the economy for one simple reason: it generates economic impact through direct spending into a community. Sports tourism is a rapidly growing niche in the travel/tourism industry. In fact, we at ActiveMedia Group share the belief that it is the fastest growing segment within the travel industry today, generating billions of dollars every year. From weekend races, to golf tournaments, to a weekend getaway in October to swim in Santorini next to the Volcano or run a half marathon in the famous Voidokoilia beach, this kind of tourism brings in tens of thousands of spectators.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) - George Floyd's brother challenged Congress on Wednesday to &quot;stop the pain&quot; as lawmakers consider a sweeping law enforcement overhaul, so the man he looked up to won't become just &quot;another name&quot; on a growing list of black Americans killed during interactions with police. Philonise Floyd's appearance before a House hearing came a day after funeral services for his older brother, the 46-year-old African American whose death has become a worldwide symbol in demonstrations calling for changes to police practices and an end to racial prejudice. Philonise Floyd told the silenced hearing room. WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday said his administration will &quot;not even consider&quot; changing the name of any of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sportsplanningguide.com/10-sports-industry-trends-for-2019/&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt; Army bases that are named for Confederate Army officers. Two days earlier, Defense Secretary Mark Esper indicated that he was open to a broad discussion of such changes. Name changes have not been proposed by the Army or the Pentagon, but on Monday, Esper and Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy indicated in response to questions from reporters that they were &quot;open to a bipartisan discussion&quot; of renaming bases such as Fort Bragg in North Carolina and Fort Benning in Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporters of disassociating military bases from Confederate Army officers argue that they represent the racism and divisiveness of the Civil War era and glorify men who fought against the United States. To amplify Trump's view, his press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, read his tweets to reporters in the White House briefing room. She said he is &quot;fervently&quot; opposed to changing the base names and believes that doing so would amount to &quot;complete disrespect&quot; for soldiers who trained there over the years. HOUSTON (AP) - Years before a bystander&Acirc;&acute;s video of George Floyd&Acirc;&acute;s last moments turned his name into a global cry for justice, Floyd trained a camera on himself. Floyd says in one video, addressing the young men in his neighborhood who looked up to him. His 6-foot-7 frame crowds the picture. At the time, Floyd was respected as a man who spoke from hard, but hardly extraordinary, experience. He had nothing remotely like the stature he has gained in death, embraced as a universal symbol of the need to overhaul policing and held up as a heroic everyman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/cSdl6zF7GAw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen title=&quot;5 months ago (c) by MotorTrend&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the reality of his 46 years on Earth, including sharp edges and setbacks Floyd himself acknowledged, was both much fuller and more complicated. BOISE, Idaho (AP) - The bodies of two children uncovered in rural Idaho are a boy and his big sister who have been missing since September, relatives said Wednesday, bringing a grim end to a search that captivated people worldwide but no fewer questions about a case that has put their mother and her husband behind bars. Authorities have not released the identities of the bodies discovered on the property of Chad Daybell, who married the children&Acirc;&acute;s mother, Lori Vallow Daybell, a few weeks after the kids were last seen. Relatives of JJ, who was 7 when he vanished, and 17-year-old Tylee Ryan sent a joint statement to Phoenix television station KSAZ-TV confirming the deaths and asking for privacy. It&Acirc;&acute;s another gruesome turn in a case that had dragged on for months without answers and grew ever stranger with its ties to the couple&Acirc;&acute;s doomsday beliefs and the mysterious deaths of their former spouses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) - Amazon on Wednesday banned police use of its face-recognition technology for a year, making it the latest tech giant to step back from law-enforcement use of systems that have faced criticism for incorrectly identifying people with darker skin. The Seattle-based company did not say why it took action now. Ongoing protests following the death of George Floyd have focused attention on racial injustice in the U.S. Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into the handcuffed black man&Acirc;&acute;s neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. Law enforcement agencies use facial recognition to identify suspects, but critics say it can be misused. A number of U.S. San Francisco last year. On Tuesday, IBM said it would get out of the facial recognition business, noting concerns about how the technology can be used for mass surveillance and racial profiling. Civil rights groups and Amazon's own employees have pushed the company to stop selling its technology, called Rekognition, to government agencies, saying that it could be used to invade people&Acirc;&acute;s privacy and target minorities.&lt;/p&gt;

It's what we use when we're doing vigorous activities and it's the primary source of fuel for our brain. The problem is, many of us eat far too much sugar. And we eat it in its simplest, processed form. This excess of sugar in our diets increases the risks of health conditions such as obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, atherosclerosis, high blood cholesterol and hypertension. It also significantly increases the risks of prematu &acirc;Ä&brvbar; Our bodies are designed to digest sugar in its naturally occurring form found in fruits, vegetables and whole grains. In these foods simple sugar molecules are joined together in a chain. Our small intestine cannot absorb sugar in the form of a carbohydrate chain (commonly known as starch), so these foods are slowly broken down, with one sugar molecule cleaved off at a time before it can be absorbed. This is like taking a long train and removing one box car at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/laM-3z9moYc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen title=&quot;10 Insane&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we eat sugar in its simplest form, such as sucrose (a combination of a glucose and fructose molecule), there is no chain to break down. So instead, a flood of sugar is released into the bloodstream all at once. We often feel this as an energy rush. Insulin is then released to shuttle the glucose into our muscles, liver and other organs to be stored for later energy use. This can leave us feeling lethargic and hungry after the spike in glucose in our blood, leading us to eat more calories than we need to, which in turn may increase our risk for obesity. There are many other ways in which a high sugar diet adversely effects our health. As we have limited stores for glucose in our body, any extra gets converted to fat. Some of this fat circulates in our blood and interferes with the work of insulin leading to further increases in blood glucose levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this continues over years, insulin begins to lose its effectiveness and blood glucose starts to rise, resulting in what's called insulin resistance and later to diabetes, another risk factor for heart disease. As the excess glucose circulates in t &acirc;Ä&brvbar; &acirc;Ä&brvbar; n of atherosclerosis. Back in the 1960s and 1970s studies began to show that dietary fat was associated with increased heart disease. This led to the first Dietary Guidelines for A &acirc;Ä&brvbar; Almost immediately, there was a proliferation of low-fat items created by the food industry resulting in trends of decreased fat intake and increased intake of added sugars in the U.S. All the while, obesity increased. At around the same time, high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) began to be introduced into foods as a sweetener given that it was cheap due to U.S. Since then, consumption of high-fructose c &acirc;Ä&brvbar; U.S. and, to a lesser extent, also in Canada. By 2004, Canadians consumed an average &acirc;Ä&brvbar;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;26 teaspoons -accounting for approximately 21 per cent of daily caloric intake. More than a third of that comes from processed foods, meaning that Canadians are eating more than 30 pounds of added sugar per year from foods with no nutritional value. In the United States, these ad &acirc;Ä&brvbar; Both amounts are well over the maximum of 10 per cent recomme &acirc;Ä&brvbar; There have been questions as to whether higher intakes of HFCS present a health concern beyond glucose. Unlike glucose, fructose is metabolized by the liver, independent of insulin. In a randomized trial, high in &acirc;Ä&brvbar; The accumulation of visceral fat c &acirc;Ä&brvbar; However, this study used levels of fructose nearly twice that of the average person's intake and may only be relevant to a small number of people with intakes that high. In recent years, concern about &quot;Big Food&quot; actin &acirc;Ä&brvbar; The scientific merit of some of the original studies pointing to dietary fat has also come into question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence is emerging that the sugar industry sponsored a research program in the 1960s and 1970s that successfully cast doubt about &acirc;Ä&brvbar; Given that the consumption of processed sugar &acirc;Ä&brvbar; However, a number of governments have begun to fight back. The most common method used to date is the imposition of a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) like soda pops and sport drinks. Mexico has already implemented such taxes to reduce consumption. While it's still early days, there is indication that intake of SSB has decreased in &acirc;Ä&brvbar; While the U.S. has no national SSB tax, many cities have undertaken to implement one, such as Philadelphia and Berkeley. There is criticism though that people may just travel outside of that city to purchase the drinks at a lower, untaxed price. At present, the evidence isn't available to support this speculation and one study found that vendors in the Philadelphia ai &acirc;Ä&brvbar;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Trends In Gaming Esports]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;img style='max-width: 320px;' class='wp-post-image' src=&quot;https://cdn.stocksnap.io/img-thumbs/960w/RV1FI77PCX.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;As the media and entertainment (M&amp;E) industry prepares for seismic shifts in video, new behavioral trends reveal that video gaming could provide more disruption in the battle for consumers&acirc;Äô attention and should be factored into most M&amp;E companies&acirc;Äô strategic planning. These shifts are increasing the legitimacy of gaming, which could also prompt video game makers and publishers to develop direct-to-consumer offerings and foster deeper ties with media and entertainment companies. Over the past few years, the growth in gaming across generations has been dramatic and swift. Overall, 30 percent of US consumers pay for a gaming subscription service, and 41 percent play video games at least weekly, according to Deloitte&acirc;Äôs Digital media trends survey, 13th edition. Indeed, there are more millennials, now, who have a gaming subscription than those with a traditional Pay TV subscription-and close to one-half of millennials and Gen Z pay for both a gaming and video streaming service.1 Increasingly, gaming has become integral to how many consumers are piecing together their own entertainment experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, many entertainment executives also acknowledged how video games, such as Fortnite, which alone has attracted 250 million players in less than two years,2 have become legitimate competitors in vying for consumers&acirc;Äô free time. At the same time, the explosion in direct-to-consumer (DTC) subscription services ahead of high-profile DTC launches from technology companies and Hollywood studios has resulted in many media companies having to navigate a competitive environment that is in flux. As consumers increasingly curate their own entertainment experiences, gaming is coming to the forefront. The compelling shifts among millennial consumers (which now includes people up to age 35 years old) reached an inflection point, with video gaming subscriptions edging ahead of Pay TV subscriptions-53 percent versus 51 percent according to Deloitte&acirc;Äôs Digital media trends survey, 13th edition. Just one year ago, video gaming subscriptions among millennials were at 44 percent and Pay TV subscriptions were 52 percent, indicating a significant shift in momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within gaming, other shifts are happening, too. Consumers are moving away from traditional video gaming platforms, such as personal computers (PCs), to mobile and app-based gaming platforms. In 2015, 77 percent of gamers played on PCs (laptop and desktop computers). That number has now declined to 48 percent, while the proportion of gamers who play on mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) grew from 70 percent in 2015 to around 80 percent in 2018. In terms of share of total gaming time, PC gaming has dropped by almost one-half, from 39 percent in 2015 to 22 percent in 2018, despite professional esports having a strong PC footprint. While the proportion of US consumers who play video games has remained steady at 70 percent in recent years, the preferred platform has shifted. Traditionally, consumers have played on consoles or PCs, but now, the percentage of time spent gaming on mobile devices has eclipsed these more traditional gaming platforms according to our survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the shifts in video gaming by platform indicate that more time is being spent gaming. The shift to mobile as a video gaming platform hints at increased usage by nontraditional gamers. And although PC gaming has decreased by percentage of total gaming time, a large portion of professional and competitive sports gaming still happens on PCs. We will focus on the two biggest video gaming platforms by proportion of overall video gaming time: mobile and console. Mobile-dominant gamers. Hardcore gamers can be dismissive of mobile gaming; they often don&acirc;Äôt regard it as &acirc;Äúpure&acirc;Äù gaming. But given that mobile is the most popular gaming platform across all consumers, it cannot be ignored. Mobile platforms also attract a bigger, new gaming audience than other platforms. Advertisers and brands may be interested to learn there are distinct differences between mobile-dominant gamers and traditional gamers. Sixty-five percent of mobile-dominant players are female, compared to 35 percent of console-dominant and 44 percent of PC-dominant players. In terms of how these consumers interact with advertising, they may be most influenced by television commercials and product placement in TV shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more media and entertainment services become available through direct-to-consumer platforms that can be instantaneously activated or canceled, it will likely become increasingly important for companies to find ways to reduce the friction consumers are feeling. To address these sources of friction, Pay TV operators could offer products that combine traditional TV, video streaming, and gaming subscriptions. The usage trends on mobile show that some traditional gaming publishers that expanded franchise titles into mobile have experienced success. In 2018, Epic Games launched Fortnite on mobile; in less than a year, it was ranked second only to Candy Crush Saga in daily transactions value,11 revealing an appetite for bigger franchise adaptations among mobile gamers. Console-dominant gamers. Gamers who prefer to use consoles are most likely to have a gaming subscription (63 percent) and they have the highest gaming utilization, with 61 percent playing at least once a week.12 More broadly, console gamers tend to value video streaming more than traditional Pay TV.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;It is no secret that the sports tech sector has exploded in recent years. Multimillion dollar deals, major funding rounds and initial public offerings (IPOs) have come thick and fast as investors of all shapes, sizes and persuasions have begun to see the revenue potential in one of the sports industry&acirc;Äôs hottest growth areas. Technology in all its forms has transformed virtually every aspect of the sports business, impacting everything from athlete training programmes and broadcast production processes to &lt;a href=&quot;https://elischolar.library.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=ceas_publication_series&quot;&gt;in&lt;/a&gt;-venue experiences and stadium construction. Its influence is such that some estimates predict the global sports tech market will surpass US$31 billion by 2024, with rising investor interest ensuring that the current influx of capital will only accelerate. Despite this momentum, however, it is not always clear where investors are spending their money, nor is it straightforward to determine which markets or sectors are attracting most investment. To make matters worse, the sports technology landscape is evolving all the time, and with so many stakeholders jostling for position it can be difficult to make sense of the global ecosystem as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-post-image&quot; src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/puIsr1JeMoE/hqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;India records over 21,000 COVID-19 cases - &euml;èô&igrave;òÅ&igrave;ÉÅ&quot; style='clear:both; float:left; padding:10px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px; max-width: 375px;' /&gt;It was with these challenges in mind that SportsTechX, a market intelligence firm for investors and professionals operating within the sports tech ecosystem, recently published its first-ever Global SportsTech VC Report. Released in November, the report incorporates graphical insights and expert perspectives in areas such as funding rounds and investor trends to provide a comprehensive overview of the sports tech landscape and the funding that underpins it. &acirc;ÄúFirst of all, it's our mission to promote the sports tech industry by presenting facts and figures, and not just some buzzwords. This simply required a global view and a deep-dive along various dimensions, such as regions, cities, sectors, sports and others.,&acirc;Äù explains Benjamin Penkert, one of two co-founders of SportsTechX. &acirc;ÄúSecondly, we realised that a dedicated report on venture capital activities was long overdue. To compile the report, Penkert and his team at Berlin-based SportsTechX analysed nearly 3,000 deals and funding rounds across five continents between January 2014 and September 2019. &acirc;ÄúWe were able to develop it within a relatively short amount of time, as the groundwork was already in place with our sports tech database that we built over the last years,&acirc;Äù says Penkert.&lt;/p&gt;

Teaming&lt;wbr&gt; ...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the standout findings in the report is that some US$12.6 billion in funding has been spent in sports tech in the past five years, with the sector having seen an compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25 per cent as well as strong increases in average and median deal sizes. Two of the biggest deals to date - Disney&acirc;Äôs buyout of BAMTech and Chinese content platform LeSports&acirc;Äô hugely successful Series B funding round - both surpassed the billion-dollar mark in 2016, while the rise of unicorns like Peloton have served to underline growing investor interest in sports tech more generally. Of all the regions tracked in the report, North America was found to dominate both in terms of deal size and volume, with US$8.16 billion spent across 1,357 funding founds since 2014. In fact, companies based on the continent have attracted some 65 per cent of all sports tech funding over the past five years. As the report notes, the USA alone accounts for nearly double the amount invested and number of rounds than in the next ten countries combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York City, which the report hails as &acirc;Äòthe sports tech capital of the world&acirc;Äô, saw just over US$3.6 billion of that investment, which amounts to around 30 per cent of the global total, while San Francisco - itself a hub for esports and fitness startups - saw nearly US$868 million. &acirc;ÄúFrom a geographical perspective it's impressive to see the strength of the US ecosystem in numbers,&acirc;Äù says Penkert. &acirc;ÄúBut China's growth and financial power is equally impressive. Globally speaking, the spread of investment dollars has grown more equal than ever before. &acirc;ÄúFor the first time in the last five years, the North American share went below 50 per cent, and all other regions grew significantly, even though partly driven by just a few big funding rounds,&acirc;Äù notes Penkert. Among European countries, the United Kingdom comes out on top, with its total of US$457.2 million invested since 2014 putting the country fourth in the global rankings.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[As Research Agendas Are Formulated In Sport-related Research]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;There are many major similarities and major differences associated with sport management from general management. True, both general business management and the sport industries must deal with marketing forces in selling/advertising their products and/or services and, if possible, operate with a positive cash flow. However, sport industry and its associated research are rare unique, according to Pedersen (2013), since sport industry has an enviable position in that it has a universal significance, ubiquitous presence, and overall importance to its growth and viability in society. Only a few corresponding examples in the non-sport world comes to mind that have similar characteristics, but most are nonprofit entities, such as healthcare and general public services. The major trend in sport management that is changing its characteristics is its research identity. Every academic discipline struggles with evolutionary changes in society attributes and how contemporary events may be framed in such a way that fits a predictive theory. The physical sciences generally have years of experimentation and active discourse on theory development to frame future research propositions and guide young scholars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center; clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/EUaqsAdLCZ8?iv_load_policy=3&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen title=&quot;22 hours ago (c) by pluralsight&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in many of the social sciences, which do not lead itself to active experimentation in most cases, there is a trend to let current events, economic and political upheaval, and public opinion shape research agendas. Sport management as an academic discipline is similarly struggling with establishing a sound theoretical framework to guide scholarly research. As research agendas are formulated in sport-related research, what are the theoretical underpinnings or paradigms that support and give credibility to such research? Unfortunately, this popularity greatly influences what is considered relevant themes or research threads, especially among doctorial students. Both Frisby (2005) and Pederson (2013) have commented that much research in sport management has been done at the micro-level, catering to new and emerging issues that have caught the attention of the public. Since American sports are becoming part of a global entertainment network, as noted by Helland (2007) and Lever &amp; Wheeler (1993), all of its products and services, including cyberspace, are subjected to intensified commercialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a unique piece of jewelry by inserting the name of your boyfriend inside a memory locket and sport it to flaunt your love in front of the world. You can easily express your emotions by choosing your own personal charms or by selecting them from various websites specializing in memory lockets and floating charms. You can also buy these lockets with charms and gift them away to your mother, brother, friend, &lt;A Href='http://www.espn.com/espn/latestnews'&gt;News&lt;/A&gt; or any other individual with whom you share a special relationship or shares beautiful times in the past. Memory lockets are not restricted to your relations alone as you can also use them to express your own personality and likes and dislikes. The memory lockets are accessories that can help you express your unique personality and taste without saying a single word. This has become a fashion these days with celebrities sporting pendants and lockets containing the names of their lovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do the same easily as these charms are very cheap and you can buy them on the internet according to your budget and taste. Is it Mother&acirc;Äôs Day or Father&acirc;Äôs Day that is approaching fast? If yes, then no matter what the gift you have selected for your mother or father, do not forget to buy a memory locket. Similarly, Valentine&acirc;Äôs Day is a very special day in the lives of all those who have someone who they love and care about. You can buy a memory locket from a store selling friendship items and insert small charms inside to gift it to your Valentine. He or she is going to be very impressed and know your true feelings. Many people buy two identical memory lockets containing same floating charms inside so that they are able to flaunt the same locket that their Valentine wears. Make your own customized gift on this Valentine&acirc;Äôs Day and surprise your Valentine.&lt;/p&gt;

And why shouldn't we, they are public figures and whatever they wear or flaunt becomes a style or a trend. Ever wonder why we just want to be like them? It's just because everyone wants to be trendy and if you are not following their trend, you are missing something and lagging behind. Definitely if you wear any outfit or any jewelry that is inspired by Angelina Jolie or Rihanna it is obvious that you knock the crowd of wherever you go and moreover you will be able to create your unique persona. Everyone wants an astounding and funky chunky look. Each person wants to prove that he or she is just rolling along with fashion. The eminent personalities who bring about these new trends in the market are the trend leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then people generally carry on with these latest trends. Trend leaders may be the TV stars, movie stars, pop stars, sport stars, top models and the icons like Michelle Obama. It is a matter of instinct and there is a simple saying that &quot;If you are not in fashion, you are nobody.&quot; Not only your outfits play an important role in giving you that getup but jewelry also give you that extra leverage that is required to be the trend leader among your peers. But while watching your favorite celebs in a movie does not gives you a proper visualization of the trends because that time we are busy actually with the movie and its story, so from where do we come to know about the celebrity trends? It is actually the awards and parties from where the trends of celebs come into being. Fashion trend can be clearly visualized in the major award shows like Oscar awards, American music awards, Emmy awards, MTV music awards fashion shows, prom nights and there are various huge events in the fashion world, which are the roots of trendy blasting events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top most celebrities enlighten these auspicious eves and bring their styles as a trend among the trendy people. For example Michelle Obama wore a beautiful gown in an inaugural ball. She empowered the style check and her presence was phenomenon along with latest fashion statement. Sandra wore a beautiful purple gown and paired it with gray diamond earrings, weighing 40 carats and after this it was the beginning of a new jewelry trend. At the world premiere of her new film The Tourist in New York City, Angelina Jolie, to complement her elegant ensemble, dangled large gem earrings. The light green diamond-cut pieces were simple and streamlined but the sheer size of the stones made the jewelry an exceptionally impressive addition to her look. Jennifer Lopez looked sensuous and stunning on the 2010 Oscars Award function with her bright white dress with separate ruffles by Armani Prive wearing gold and silver earrings. Christina Aguilera was seen with a gold and red stones ring in the Oscars 2009. So the conclusion is that Jewelry is also a mark of completion to the beauty of a woman, as it add up grace and charm to her elegant persona. Whether it s a formal day or a special event like wedding, anniversary etc, be it an ordinary or expensive, simple subtle or stylish it is incomplete without jewelry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although they watch the least amount of live broadcast TV, when they do, they watch the most live sports: 31 percent watch more than four hours per week compared with an average of 24 percent across all gamers.13 Console-dominant gamers gravitate toward paid and ad-supported video streaming services; they stream 17 hours of video per week and 84 percent pay for a video streaming subscription service.14 Compared to mobile-dominant players, console gamers may be more frustrated by having to manage multiple streaming services than they are by advertising disruptions. In terms of reaching and influencing these gamers, video-game advertising, unsurprisingly, likely has the greatest impact. Our survey showed that console-dominant gamers place a high value on gaming subscriptions and original content. In addition, given the percentage of console-dominant consumers who watch esports events at least once a week, they have above-average esports viewing frequency. To respond to these trends, connectivity and entertainment providers could target these gamers by offering fast broadband and console-related video services, such as live sports, monetizing this audience more optimally through over-the-top (OTT) ad-supported services. Video gaming companies, meanwhile, could offer higher-priced gaming subscription services that could include access to exclusive original content and esports events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While esports currently represents less than 5 percent of the overall US video gaming market, our study shows that professional gaming events are gaining traction. Among gamers, 40 percent watch esports events at least once a week. And 25 percent of gamers who watch esports events tune in for more than four hours per week. The figure for total video game-related viewing is most likely higher.15 Esports events, usually organized contests between professional players, make up only 30 percent of overall gaming viewing. Gamers use major platforms such as Amazon&acirc;Äôs Twitch and Alphabet&acirc;Äôs YouTube to watch these events.16 Whether it&acirc;Äôs professional events or watching individual player streams, many consumers don&acirc;Äôt just like playing video games; they like to watch the best play against one another. Given that content production is often one of traditional media companies&acirc;Äô key strengths, these companies could engage with game creators and players to create video game-related content such as reality TV, docuseries, and other forms of live competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sheinbaum has acknowledged that the real number of deaths in Mexico City is surely higher, but says an independent panel will have to review suspected cases and make a determination. City death records reported by an anti-corruption watchdog group suggested the death toll could be three times as high in the capital. The rest of the city's economic activity won't be allowed to resume until hospital occupancy drops below 59%. Even then, restaurants, hotels and churches will be limited to 30% of their capacity. Sports are to resume without fans. But in professional soccer, Mexico's most popular sport that has been shut down since March 15, club owners are still debating whether to restart their season or just call it off. Fanny Alejandra Manriquez Ezquivel, a city employee who has continued working and not quarantined at home, said Wednesday that she thinks it is time for the city to return to some semblance of normality.&lt;/p&gt;

So what &lt;em&gt;trends&lt;/em&gt; should we expect to see in 2019? Esports sponsorship has&lt;wbr&gt; ...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;English rugby needs to adopt a central contract system as the game addresses the financial problems which have been exposed by this lockdown. Clubs have been forced to cut player wages and there is unrest within many squads about the way the process has been handled. But the fact is that the Premiership elite - with the exception of Exeter - are in varying amounts of debt and there are fears that some could go out of business. Salary inflation has been one of the key trends of recent years but clubs' income has not kept pace. Teams are spending beyond their means in order to compete. English Rugby is boring! Wealthy owners are keeping the league afloat, but there is a real prospect of the bubble bursting soon. There is an earnings gulf in England's top division. After learning that he would not be offered a new contract, veteran Leicester flanker Guy Thompson told The Mail on Sunday: 'You can't have a handful of players taking 80 per cent of the wages and everyone else scrapping for the 20 per cent that's left. He is right. The well-paid few are vastly outnumbered by the underpaid many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a wonder that there has not been more resentment between team-mates as this trend has taken hold. At a time when players are objecting to how their clubs are forcing through pay cuts which many fear will become permanent, there is an answer. Central contracts. Most club owners would run a mile from the concept and the RFU are also fearing hardship ahead, but it could be done. Sell the naming rights to Twickenham: that would pay for it. Why not have England's top 30 players contracted for a season in three pay bands - &Acirc;&pound;300,000 for those with fewer than 25 caps, &Acirc;&pound;450,000 for those with 25-50 caps and &Acirc;&pound;600,000 for those with more than a half-century of caps? Others could be added and paid on a pro rata basis, as required. England players earn &Acirc;&pound;25,000 for each international appearance. That appears unsustainable, too, but a drop in money could be accompanied by a fall in workload. They could have a limit of 10-12 club games per season, on a fee-per-appearance arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;

When I walked around some websites several days ago in order to find new dress up games, I found out some articles forecasting 2013 fashion trends. By accident, while I didn't know to do with my free time on the last weekend, my friends suggested me play new dress up games or some games for girls to kill the time. When I typed some key words to find games, I found several websites introducing their new products for new year. They attracted me and I start to want myself to be changed with new fashion style which is suitable with new trends. Sometimes, which costumes we dress depends on how we feel. How we look also make us more confident, some people said that success is also brought from the way we dress. Meanwhile, the clothing, hair, beauty and accessory trends change each year, how we can catch up with them. Not because we have to follow them, but because they inspire us, how we can adapt them to our own personal style in a way that suits us. In the website fashioning, they gave some forecasts for spring. First of all is belted floral dresses. This floral pattern was hot trend for the last summer and I got some in my wardrobe. However, to make it different and new, it can be combine with the belt.&lt;/p&gt;

While the &lt;em&gt;trend&lt;/em&gt; of new sporting formats and leagues.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the National Survey for Sport and Physical Education's Shape of the Nation report released in 1997, nearly half the nation's youths between the ages of 12 and 21 and more than one-third of high school students did not participate in vigorous physical activity on a regular basis. Fewer than one in four children got 20 minutes of vigorous activity every day, and one in four children did not attend any physical education class. Some school districts have cut phys-ed teachers from some school staffs. In California, classroom teachers provide phys-ed instruction in more than 90 percent of the elementary schools, according to SPARK (Sports, Play and Active Recreation for Kids), a nonprofit elementary physical education and staff development program affiliated with the San Diego State University Foundation. Anne Flannery, executive director of P.E.4Life, a not-for-profit organization that promotes expanding and revamping PE programs. By a quality program, P.E.4Life means one centered around activities that students can do throughout their lives, Flannery says. At the same time, P.E.4Life does not think team sports should be completely eliminated from phys-ed curriculums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paula Kun, spokesperson for the National Association for Sport and Physical Education, a nonprofit professional organization for phys-ed teachers and professors, agrees that PE curriculums have to change. According to Kun, the traditional dodge ball game does not belong in a quality phys-ed program mainly because students are eliminated, so not everyone is active during the game. Have you seen these phys-ed resources from the Education World archive? Be Fit for Life' Says P.E. Girls and Sports -- A Winning Combination! The Web Puts 'Fizz' Into Phys-ical Fitness! Inactivity in gym class is one of the problems with traditional programs, according to Paul Rosengard, executive director of SPARK. Rosengard tells Education World. SPARK staff members visit schools and evaluate their phys-ed curriculum for a fee, as well as provide curriculum and equipment. Many of the schools SPARK works with do not have the money for exercise equipment, so SPARK staff members suggest activities that don't require expensive equipment and curriculum modifications so more students can participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifth graders, for example, might prepare to play softball by working in pairs to field ground balls, so they can give each other feedback on their fielding technique. Then they can play a modified softball game, in which all the fielders have to relay the ball before it can be thrown home. For a new spin on running laps, students can be assigned to see how many playing cards they can collect from a teacher while running for ten minutes. While they are cooling down, students can do a math problem using the numbers on the cards they collected, Rosengard explains. In the past few years, new activities have started to appear in gym classes, such as orienteering, mountain biking, and in-line skating, according to Kun. Some students and staff also have access to indoor exercise equipment, such as treadmills and stationary bicycles. An example of such a phys-ed program is at Madison Junior High School in Naperville, Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pluto TV app. In January 2020, Cinedigm and all3media International announced a joint venture to launch two new AVOD-driven services exclusively in the U.S., based around dramatic and reality programming. Comcast's Peacock will be the heavyweight arrival into this space with an offer to advertisers of a combined 52 million NBCUniversal and Sky customers in the U.S. Operators have enough granular control over the system that they could launch tiered services and give consumers flexibility to balance how much they want to pay versus how many ads they want to see. There are new opportunities afforded by new technology too. Walmart-owned Vudu plans to introduce shoppable ads, allowing viewers to place the advertised item in question in a Walmart shopping cart so they can buy it online or pick it up in a store.

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Digital Media To Take On The Gaming Action Of The Future Sporting - Advertising]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;As with the advent of the digital revolution, there have been too many reserves on the internet to track your favorite sport or your favorite team down to the wire. With the need of dynamic and consistent services that needs to be reckoned for the modern sports viewers, the stakes have never been so high in the media industry all across the world. From Skating to Football, there has been a complete tyrant when it comes to viewership. As with the Sports Industry Jobs, there have been too many new paths that have been driving the horizon on the new generation sporting facility. What makes the real difference in conventional mode of Sports broadcasts and the modern facility is the need of process data to deliver the ultimate reserve for the sporting community. For instance, the English Premier League is no longer the popular event in the European countries, but also in the East and the Americas. The trends have been so compromising that local reserves have been looking out for options with sporting information in the broader and brief context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the need for more information and processed news is indicating the rising need of sports experts to deal with the needful for many of the facilities worldwide. Though the vast majority of the viewers of the sporting action on the internet directly relates to the Sports Business News, there is a more significant rise in the people who prefer watching live action on the internet. However, ESPN Star Network has been one of the larger of a lot of the reserves on the internet that has been dealing with live telecast, none of the other facility on the internet has been bad as well. So, there is a huge potential for Sports Management Jobs that could be on the scale for the future. Especially with the likes of the internet being one of the more opted medium for sports related viewership, the prospects tends to be higher than any other medium that is around. As with the statistics for football and cricket in Asia, the trends has been pretty biased on the live telecast being watched on the internet. But, all across the Americas and Africa, Internet viewership has been on the high better than ever with one in every five viewers getting the action through the means of the internet. Despite the increasing trends of internet viewership for sporting action, the growth for an infrastructural platform for Sports is evidently on the lower side. This is especially because the need for talented professionals who needs to be brought into the real picture. But, as with the prospects, the rise is expected to fill the gap in as much less time possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former big-league players Torii Hunter, Barry Larkin, Gary Pettis and Terry Pendleton have been mentioned in recent years as candidates - lacking managerial experience shouldn&acirc;Äôt be a detriment because plenty of today&acirc;Äôs managers had zero previous experience. Lloyd McClendon, one of two African American bench coaches (he&acirc;Äôs with Detroit), Jerry Manuel and Bo Porter have plenty of managing experience in the majors. McClendon was the last African American hired to manage in the majors before Baker and Roberts. &acirc;ÄúIt&acirc;Äôs gotten to where in the NFL and NBA, you need African American coaches because there are more African American players to relate to,&acirc;Äù Baker said. &acirc;ÄúIn baseball, you&acirc;Äôre not going to see as many African American managers because there aren&acirc;Äôt many African Americans on the field. Venable is a strong candidate. He grew up in San Rafael, the son of former Giants outfielder Max Venable, is well-respected and well-liked, played nine seasons in the majors, mostly with the Padres, and coached first base for the Cubs the past two years following a brief stint as a special assistant to Cubs President Theo Epstein.&lt;/p&gt;

Beltran is among six minority managers, joining Alex Cora (Red Sox), Dave Martinez (Nationals), Rick Renteria (White Sox), Charlie Montoyo (Blue Jays) and Roberts, who&acirc;Äôs half African American and half Japanese. While one in three players is Latino, just 17% of managers are Latino. And, of course, 3.3% of managers are African American. &acirc;ÄúPrograms are in place,&acirc;Äù said Brooks, noting the so-called Selig Rule that requires teams to interview minorities for managing and top executive positions. &acirc;ÄúGetting kids playing is first and foremost - and helping them to be in position to play college baseball. Lapchick releases his report card every April 15, Jackie Robinson Day, covering the previous season. While he gave excellent grades for racial hiring of players and coaches in 2018, the racial hiring grade for managers was C-. It&acirc;Äôll be slightly better for 2019 because the number of minority managers increased from three to four.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Sunglasses have become crucial accessories in today's world. Earlier, a pair of sunglasses was used for the sole purpose of protecting your eyes from harmful radiations of the sun. Now, with the rapidly mushrooming fashion needs of the savvy population, sunglasses have become major style markers in the world of fashion. However, the main motive of protecting the eyes still holds true. Sunglasses can accentuate any look and make you grab attention. The perfect pair of sunglasses can cover up for the entire look, even if you are not dressed the right way. Historically and factually, this pair of protective eyewear had its beginnings as early as 1752 under the able brain of James Ayscough. However, it took time for the trend of wearing sunglasses to be accepted and hit the commercial floors. Today, with the modernisation seeping in, the eyewear has undergone drastic changes and more and more efforts are being made to give complete protection to your eyes, while catering to your styling needs as well. While choosing a pair of sunglasses, you should primarily focus on a pair which provides a protective barricade for your eyes and not merely a fashion accessory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q7UrDnNcM_4?modestbranding=1&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen title=&quot;2009 Volkswagen CC&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence, the types of lenses play an important role before a purchase. You can get various types of lenses including polarised, mirrored, gradient, photochromic, glass and plastic lenses made of acrylic, polycarbonate or polyurethane. Polarised lenses are made with a coat of plastic sheet to reduce the bright light reflected from a non-metallic surface such as water. You can wear it to the beach which requires you to see the water. These types of lenses are ideal for people who are around a water body for a longer period of time, such as fishermen. Mirrored sunglasses work by deflecting light on hitting the surface of the lenses so that it does not transmit inside, thus protecting your eyes from strong glare. This type of lens prevents scattering of light rays. Gradient lenses are made in such a way that they are darker on the top and transparent at the bottom. These are tinted to prevent the wearer from bright sky light while driving. Photochromic sunglasses, as the name suggests, turn darker when exposed to harsh sunlight and protect your eyes from the harmful UV rays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polycarbonate plastic lenses are lightweight and scratch-resistant and suit the wearer's needs and preferences as opposed to glass lenses, which are breakable. Keeping in mind the latest technological advancements, some of the brands offer sunglasses with the option of interchangeable lenses. Lenses are available in various colours ranging from a neutral shade to a brighter one. They can be blue, green, yellow, turquoise, grey, brown, purple and many more. Frames also form an important aspect of sunglasses to a large extent. Frames are usually made of materials such as nylon, plastic, metal or an alloy of a metal. With its lightweight and flexible nature, nylon frames are typically used for sports-related activities. The nylon frames provide a firm grip to the sports person's face so that he/she can indulge in the game comfortably. Metal frames are mostly used for non-sport activities because of their rigidity. These are durable and sturdy and can be used for almost all purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of them are designed with hinges along with springs attached to enhance flexibility. Some of the sunglasses also have a nose bridge to provide comfortable support to your face. Frames can be of three types - full frame, half frame and frameless. You can choose the one which feels comfortable on your face. Sunglasses are available in a variety of styles to suit every face shape. You can get styles such as aviator, wayfarer, cat-eye, over-sized, rectangular, round, spectacle, sports or wrap-around and oval. While choosing a pair of sunglasses, keep in mind your face shape for a wise buy. Square frames call for round sunglasses, whereas for a heart-shaped face, rectangular sunglasses are ideal. If you have a square face, you can go for softer-edged frames, oval, round, cat-eye or any thin frames. Rimless or oval frames suit a diamond-shaped face. For a triangle-shaped face, cat-eye or brightly coloured frames accentuate the look. Wider frames are ideal for long faces. Choosing an appropriate frame for an oval face shape is the most convenient as every kind of frame suits their face. Caring for your pair of sunglasses is important to retain its properties. Use a flannel cloth to clean the lenses of the sunglasses and store them in the box when not in use. Brands like Fastrack, Oakley, Idee, Carrera, Maui Jim, Ray-Ban, Luxottica and so on offer a wide variety of sunglasses to suit your needs and preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

Shape: Not necessary that your favourite movie star's sunglasses would be a good fit on your round face. He needs aviators but you, as per the face guide, need wayfarers. Though there are many shapes available in the fashion market online, however you got to know how to find perfect one for yourself. For that you can prefer sunglasses guide, there are sunglasses for every face cut, as simple as that. UV Protection: People sport sunglasses mostly during summers so as to protect their eyes and faces being scorched by unrelenting sun rays. Rather than style quotient, this should by your frontline thought while buying a pair of sunglasses online or from a store. Hence, always go for polarized and anti-reflective lenses - they best protect eyes from UV rays. Material: Your sunglasses should be light, durable and shattered resistance. Nearly all frames and lenses in sunglasses are made of plastic material. However, if the material used is of deplorable level, then you aren't getting your best buy. Always get a pair which is made up of good plastic like CR-39 which offers durability, shock-resistance and lightweight. Shade: Sunglasses come in shades, not in bold colours. The value and the purpose of a shade differ from occasion to occasion. You cannot carry the grey-tinted driving shade on a beach picnic. Actually, it all depends upon the kind of blue light or glare you face. With shades you seek your comfort: no dark view at the same time in the pursuit of blocking excessive sunlight. Some of the popular shades are grey, amber, gradient, and brown lenses (especially for beach).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports say that US employees had urged against the use of the slide but that Klaass and his team had gone ahead with it anyway. The slide was shown to more than 100 attendees and was meant as a serious attempt to show how Red Bull is a global organization, insiders said. Red Bull's headquarters are in Austria where the energy drink was first sold in 1987, before it broke into the US market in the 1990s and became the dominant player by the mid-2000s. The company's global CEO is Austrian billionaire Dietrich Mateschitz, who has an estimated fortune of $26billion and owns a private island in Fiji. In a 2017 interview, Mateschitz expressed sympathy with Donald Trump and said the new president 'simply needs time'. I don't think he's as much of an idiot as he's made out to be,' he told the newspaper Kleine Zeitung at the time. When you speak to Americans you often hear that they're essentially happy to have a new administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was plenty to question about the previous one,' he said, referring to the Obama administration. Raging at 'political correctness' and the 'intellectual elite', Mateschitz was also highly critical of Germany and Austria for opening their doors at the height of the 2015 refugee crisis. Taking aim at those who encouraged refugees or used Angela Merkel's slogan of 'we'll manage it', he said that none of those people 'made their guest rooms available for five migrants to live in'. Mateschitz is also responsible for a television station called Servus TV which is owned by Red Bull, and which has faced criticism for allowing 'right-wing extremists' to appear in its broadcasts. Among the guests to appear on Servus TV was Martin Sellner, a member of the Generation Identity group who has been barred from entering Britain and the US. A report by Austrian newspaper Der Standard in July 2019 claimed that the head of the TV network was now reporting directly to Mateschitz rather than Red Bull bosses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017 Mateschitz also unveiled plans to start a new platform called Closer To The Truth, which was compared to the right-wing &lt;a href=&quot;https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/sports-private-equity-investments-pandemic&quot; &gt;news&lt;/a&gt; site Breitbart. Some Red Bull employees told Business Insider that the company's leadership saw the Black Lives Matter protests as an American issue that did not affect the global brand. Others claim that the offensive slide at the Detroit presentation had been reported to HR but that no action had been taken. Taylor and Kozak are said to have worked together over the last several years on efforts to increase diversity at Red Bull. Taylor wanted the company to speak out about racism and was working on a project to increase black representation but the company leadership was 'not interested', sources claim. The Red Bull F1 team did put a statement out on June 22 speaking of its 'determination to tackle the challenges that we as a sport, but also society, are facing', saying that racism 'has no place in our modern world'.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Update Your Style Game With These 5 Sneakers For Women - Shoes &amp; Footwear]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The much popular trend of sneakers for women has taken the fashion world by its grip. The trend had shown tremendous versatility and has brought an evolution in the fashion world. Fashion elites have developed a love for chunky sports-style sneakers for women. These are padded shoes that have grooved high-grip soles and athletic details. The style when styled right, chunky sports sneakers can be totally chic. The best way to pull off a well styled look is to balance them with light and feminine pieces of clothing. The contrast of styles will modernize this shoe and bring it from retro to current era. While the trend has been a favorite among men, women have been more reserved about the style. This season, however, the style is a favored amongst female fashion stars. One must know the look they are going for and choose from diverse varieties of high top sneakers to find the ones that best suit your personality and style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High top sneakers look best when paired with modern styles that reflect a bit of attitude. The Fashion world loves making a statement, and the color pop sneaker trend is no exception to this rule. While the majority of people have shown an undeniable love towards white sneakers, color pop is the next if one feels satiated enough. There is always a room for a pop of color in the wardrobes of fashion savvies. You can start with colored laces if you are skeptical about plunging into the color pop trend and slowly make your way upwards. Metallic sneakers have been spotted all over the sidewalks. The key to this trend is to keep the attention to the shoes and making the rest of the palette neutral to achieve the same. Choose simple and casual pieces like a boyfriend jeans or pleated midi are two among the most preferred choices. If you are trying to achieve an edgier look, flat form sneakers are your go to sneakers to try on. They are regular sneakers that feature a flat sole that is thick (usually about an inch or so). The exclusive look has a heavy and fairly masculine appeal that is perfect for creating a causal look that signifies attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dana White said that in the build up to Saturday's event, the UFC administered 1,200 tests, on 300 people. UFC 249 suffered a huge blow on Friday after Jacare Souza had to pull out of his fight against Uriah Hall after testing positive for coronavirus, with plenty ready to slam the organisation for putting the fighters' health at risk. Dana White has insisted that all fighters were being regularly tested for the virus and were undergoing anti-bodies tests, while temperatures of all surrounding staff were being monitored daily. The promotion were also quick to ensure that no fighter criticised the UFC's approach to health and safety during the event. Reuter's news agency reports that all fighters taking part in UFC 249 were asked to sign an eight-page event participation agreement. It will be interesting to see whether other sports follow that trend in an effort to seek full harmony among athletes competing during the crisis. The clause garnered criticism from Showtime Boxing's Stephen Espinoza, to which White responded with a less-than-flattering appraisal of Espinoza's character. Despite the farce with Souza, UFC 249 will be viewed as an overwhelming success by White and his cronies. With two more events coming from Jacksonville this week, the UFC train is showing no signs of slowing. It's a mad world but for the short run, we are going to have to embrace it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center; clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ry2_N4XkVCU?showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0&amp;controls=2&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen title=&quot;Ford Focus 1.6 Ti-vct 16v Trend Sport, 125 pk&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increasing media glare on celebrities has made it important for everyone to dress up to look cool and trendy. For those looking to sport the trendy and happening look, you can choose from the latest range of clothes from Fox Racing and RVCA. These clothes have always been synonymous with style and trend. Fox clothing originated from motor cross, but has now spread to sports like mountain biking, wakeboarding and surfing. These are the best bet for those looking for a great range of T- Shirts, hoodies, caps, board shorts, jeans and jackets. RVCA too, has been associated with style that transcends the boundaries of traditional action sports apparel. Their style has remained free from fashion trends and has managed to be a design driven lifestyle brand. RVCA clothes range from basic surf wear to vintage inspired sportswear. It's easy to buy Fox Racing clothing and RVCA clothes at surf shops all over the country. But rather than buying these clothes through retail stores, you could buy them through online stores that sell the latest range of surf clothing. These online sites often buy them in bulk directly from the retailer at wholesale prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since these clothes are purchased at throwaway prices, they are sold at affordable rates. Besides, online retailers do not have to worry about paying for overhead costs and hence can afford to sell them at rates that are cheaper than retail stores. Most online retailers offer free shipping for purchases above a stipulated amount, making it convenient for people to shop online. But remember to buy these clothes from a reputed online retailer. Not every online retailer sells quality merchandise. Either the quality is cheap or the product that's delivered is different from the one that was ordered. A reputed online retailer would take care to ensure that the displayed merchandise is in stock. Before you place the order, remember to read the terms and conditions. The fine print is what matters most, when it comes to a legal dispute. These terms and conditions discuss about the conditions for return of goods. A reputed online retailer generally accepts goods that are returned within 30 days of its purchase. Make sure that your online payments are secure. Also remember to make a quick assessment about the reputation of the seller through a Google search. A dissatisfied customer is sure to make it known to the world and thus save you from being conned.&lt;/p&gt;

One trend against the use of child labour laws in sporting contexts is the increasing assertion of the rights of parents to make choices on behalf of their children, and the resistance to some notion of the &acirc;Äúnanny state&acirc;Äù that regulates these choices from above. Yet we would not support a parent&acirc;Äôs right to choose to allow their child to work long hours in stressful employment. The decision cannot solely be left in the hands of parents who may benefit, either economically or socially, from their child&acirc;Äôs participation in the sport. The decision also cannot be left to the sports coaches and administrators, as they are caught up in the system goal of high performance. Will this mean the abolition of all elite sport development for children and adolescents?

Total confirmed infections nationwide grew to 56,594, though the real number is probably several times higher because Mexico performs so little testing. With about 9 million residents, the capital is one of the world's largest cities. Authorities predicted the pandemic is nearing its peak in Mexico City, but hospitals in the capital are already about three-quarters full. As of Tuesday night, Mexico City reported more than 15,000 confirmed coronavirus infections and nearly 1,500 deaths. Despite it all, Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum said Mexico City will begin a gradual reopening June 1, when some sectors of the economy would be allowed to resume operations. While Sheinbaum called on residents to continue taking social distancing measures through June 15, impatience with being shut up at home, household financial demands and a lack of any enforcement already drew more and more people back into the streets in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Trends To Watch Out For In Sports Marketing]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;In the world of sports marketing, a fan is like a god. You have to keep finding ways to please them, engage them, and seek their love. As a sports marketer, you have to remain on your toes to tap into the latest industry trends and make the most out of them. Earlier sponsorship was limited to attaching the brand name to the jersey, sports equipment or the stadium. However, with technology taking a center stage, the rules of sponsorship has also changed a bit. Social media, which now has the biggest share of a fan&acirc;Äôs attention, is an integral part of sponsorship programs. Fans are quite vocal about their preferences on social media, often liking or following a brand that is associated with their favorite team or player. 30% of the fans who connect with a sponsor through social media later end up making a purchase. However, a sports marketer has to remain extra careful to keep the connection genuine. No trend has been as dominant as the slow and steady rise of female fan power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are witnessing a slew of sports marketing campaigns that theme around women fan following and recognize female sportsperson the same way they did men. Advertisers are now increasing their focus on female fans of sports which are predominantly male. The same movement can be expected in female sports as well. We are witnessing a slew of sports marketing campaigns that theme around women fan following and recognize female sportsperson the same way they did men. Advertisers are now increasing their focus on female fans of sports which are predominantly male. The same movement can be expected in female sports as well. For instance, there is a sizeable male population that watches tennis and roots for Serena Williams, Maria Sharapova and many others who have successfully managed to stay in the limelight for the right reasons. These players are already successful endorsers and have been successfully leveraged by brands to promote products. The best example of a female-centric ad campaign is Under Armour with Misty Copeland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since its debut on Youtube, the ad has garnered over 10 million views and unsurprisingly Under Armour&acirc;Äôs women&acirc;Äôs business has also grown 60 percent YoY to $600 million. This illustrates that there are many possibilities to be explored in this area. Digital media has led to a revolution of sorts in the world of sports marketing. Over a short period of time, there has been a major paradigm shift all due to the popularity of social media amongst sports lovers. There are plenty of facts that support the case of social media as a marketing platform in the current age. 83% of fans check social media while enjoying their favorite game on TV while 63% use social media when they are at the stadium watching the action live. Front row is simply not good enough for people anymore! One of the reasons can be cited to the ability of social media to enable direct connection between fans and the athletes. Hangouts or Facebook Live Q/A, giving their fans a first-hand peek into their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background:rgba(0,0,0,0.1);padding:0px 10px 1px 10px;border-radius:5px;border:1px solid #000;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nielsen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Nielsen_Top5_Commercial_Trends_2018.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;top 5 global sports industry trends - Nielsen&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;cite&gt;www.nielsen.com&lt;span class=&quot;eipWBe&quot;&gt; &acirc;Ä&ordm; 2019/04&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;color:rgba(0,0,0,0.6);&quot;&gt;When we first sat down to discuss the &lt;em&gt;trends&lt;/em&gt; affecting the &lt;em&gt;sports&lt;/em&gt; business in 2018&lt;wbr&gt;, it was clear that the most significant of these had been with us for some years.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&acirc;Äôs more heartening to know as a sports marketing agent, 68% of social media users are either indifferent or like their favorite sports personalities posting marketing messages and making sponsored posts on Twitter. This is the biggest takeaway which supports the case of social media as a sports marketing and advertising platform. Smart brands are already finding ways to engage their audience. Another manifestation of rising dependence on technology is the increasing use of mobile. Every brand person, advertiser and sports marketer is now seeking ways to capitalize the immense potential that mobile technology holds to improve the fan experience irrespective of their location. With around 70% of spectators using mobile in stadiums, there is a lot that one can do to attract more fans to a particular sporting event, for instance building a free high-speed arena Wi-Fi system. Using mobile apps for check-ins, finding seats, checking the schedule, booking tickets is now becoming a commonplace. Organizers of sporting events and marketers can leverage this fact to their advantage. &acirc;ÄúSports is a people business, so we&acirc;Äôre looking for ways to use technology to further engage with people,&acirc;Äù said John Abbamondi, vice president of the NBA&acirc;Äôs Team Marketing &amp; Business Operations division. One thing is for sure, people looking to carve a career out of marketing and that too in sports must be tech savvy and diligent enough to keep a constant tab on the changing pulse of the industry, lest they want to be forgotten and ignored by the fans.

&lt;p&gt;Changes from year to year embed surfboards in designs such as shark fin shapes that make surfboards lighter. In 1950 was created 'Wetsuit' (clothing used in water spot activities) that made surfers last longer in the water. The popularity of surf climbed up when Dale Velzy became the first sponsored sponsor for a very lively campaign. Surf-themed films such as the movie 'Gidget and Endless Summer' make this water sport a trend and a hobby for the whole world. Now surfing is not only a Hawaiian culture but a business that promises big profits. Surfing is also an adrenaline and extreme water sport. The most popular place of surfers is on the south coast of Bali, because there are many clusters of coral that make waves getting bigger, and it becomes an exciting challenge for surfers. Here's a list of beaches that become a favorite of surfers like Padang-Padang Beach, Impossible Beach, Suluban Beach, Kuta Beach, Seminyak Beach, Canggu Beach, Keramas Beach and many other beaches. If you cannot surf there is a class to learn to surf because before you start on the beach you should be able to surf so you are safe and safe.

&lt;p&gt;In 1984, the winner of the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest was a 17 year-old, 130-pound German Judo athlete named Brigit Feldman. She had never eaten an American hot dog before she claimed the title with 9.5 hotdogs in ten minutes. Flash forward to 2001, and Japanese competitor Takeru Kobayashi doubled the existing hot dog eating record from 25 hot dogs consumed in 12 minutes to 50 hot dogs over the same time period. If you want to see how fast sport can push the limits of human performance, you don't have to look much further than a speed-eating competition. The Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, which takes place each July 4 on Coney Island, seems like a silly game, but if the exponential performance gains achieved in fewer than 20 years prove anything, it's that it's already become a serious competition. According to a recent paper in the journal Biological Letters, the limit appears to be 84 hot dogs.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Russians Cut Back On Drinking, Smoking As Fitness Trend Grows]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Vodka might still serve as a national symbol but last year Russians drank less alcohol per capita than the French or Germans, according to World Health Organization data that factored in consumption of bootleg booze. And tobacco use also plummeted by more than a fifth between 2009 and 2016, down to 30 percent of Russians smoking according to the most recent Global Adult Tobacco Survey. World Health Organization's representative in Russia Dr. Melita Vujnovic told AFP. She said if the trend continues, Russian rates would be comparable to Scandinavia and the United Kingdom in a decade. Vujnovic points to legislation gradually introduced over the last 13 years to combat a public health crisis and boost life expectancy, including a ban on shops selling any alcohol after 11 pm, increases in the minimum retail price of spirits, and an advertising blackout. In 1990 total alcohol consumption in Russia was below 12 litres, following restrictions imposed by the last Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this steadily increased after the collapse of the USSR until 2007, according to the WHO. Cigarette prices are still well below European levels, going for around $2 (1.6 euros) a packet, but Vujnovic praised Russia's tobacco control programme as &quot;one of the best in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jd.id/product/casio-baby-g-world-time-ba-120kt-7ajr-sport-trend-women-s-watch-46mm_51879296/504221986.html&quot;&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;&quot; judging by the results. Elena Dmitrieva, director of the Moscow-based NGO the Health and Development Foundation, agreed that government policies were the major factor but suggested a general trend towards healthy living was also behind the cut back in smoking and drinking, especially in larger cities. Anton, a 32-year-old Muscovite who organises mixed martial arts tournaments, gave up drinking a decade ago following problems with alcohol and is instead putting his energies into sports. Anton, who declined to give his last name. Yaroslav, a 26-year-old who works in the visual arts and quit smoking at around the time it was banned in bars and restaurants, said that it was gradually becoming less socially acceptable to smoke. Yaroslav, who grew up in the Arctic Circle city of Murmansk.&lt;/p&gt;

With awe-inspiring ski jumps that seem to pierce the crystal blue sky, modern Telemark skiing enthusiasts like Scott Robarge carry on the Norwegian tradition across the great snow covered ski slopes of North America and Europe. Scott Robarge, a sought after professional recruiter specializing in the technology sector. Telemark skiing requires a different style and different equipment than traditional alpine skiing. Telemark skiers require great strength and agility to navigate difficult turns and moves along the slope. The skis used for telemarking have a binding that only connects the boot to the ski at the toes, similar to the equipment used in cross-country skiing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Telemark turns are led with the heel flat on the outside ski, while the inside ski is pulled directly beneath the skier's body with a lowered knee and raised heel. The skis are staggered but not exactly parallel, and at least half the body weight is distributed on the outer ski, depending on the weather and snow conditions. Sondre Norheim is widely considered to be the &quot;Father of Modern Skiing.&quot; He left his home in Telemark, Norway to move to the rugged American Northwest and popularized the sport of skiing. Previously, skiing was generally used as a means of transportation rather than recreation. Today skiing is one of the most popular outdoor sports in the world and a fixture of the Winter Olympics. There are a number of organizations for U.S. The United States Telemark Ski Association, a non-profit organization with a mission to promote Telemark skiing through educational clinics and sanctioned racing competitions. The North American Telemark Organization provides the Telemark and backcountry ski instruction throughout North America and has helped over forty thousand people master Telemark skiing. Advances in equipment and training have encouraged others to join the trend -- Telemark is enjoying a renaissance. Scott Robarge has skied at many of the great ski resorts across the country, but &quot;I'm always looking to learn something new to get better. The more you ski and learn, the more effortless it becomes,&quot; he says. The quest for the perfect run always lies ahead on the next mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[IOC Approves Five New Sports For Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 - Olympic News]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/w-gikISR5ek?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;fs=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen title=&quot;2010 Volkswagen CC&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision by the 129th IOC Session in Rio de Janeiro was the most comprehensive evolution of the Olympic programme in modern history. Plans call for staging the skateboarding and sports climbing events in temporary venues installed in urban settings, marking a historic step in bringing the Games to young people and reflecting the trend of urbanisation of sport. Today&acirc;Äôs vote was the culmination of a two-year process that began with the unanimous approval of the IOC&acirc;Äôs strategic roadmap in 2014. The recommendation to give Organising Committees the flexibility to propose new sports for their edition of the Games was intended to put even more focus on innovation, flexibility and youth in the development Olympic programme. IOC President Thomas Bach said, &acirc;ÄúWe want to take sport to the youth. With the many options that young people have, we cannot expect any more that they will come automatically to us. We have to go to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tokyo 2020&acirc;Äôs balanced proposal fulfils all of the goals of the Olympic Agenda 2020 recommendation that allowed it. The additional sports in Tokyo will not impact the athlete or event quotas of existing Olympic sports or be binding on future host cities. The current athlete and event quotas are unaffected. The IOC considered a variety of factors when assessing the proposal, including the impact on gender equality, the youth appeal of the sports and the legacy value of adding them to the Tokyo Games. The inclusion of the new sports will add 18 events and 474 athletes, with equal numbers of women and men for all sports except baseball/softball, which will have the same number of teams but different player totals, because softball teams have 15 players whilst baseball teams have 24. Tokyo 2020 will rely heavily on existing and temporary venues to stage the competitions. Discussions on the event programme in the existing 28 Olympic sports for the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 are ongoing, and will be finalised by the IOC Executive Board in mid-2017. The International Olympic Committee is a not-for-profit independent international organisation made up of volunteers, which is committed to building a better world through sport. It redistributes more than 90 per cent of its income to the wider sporting movement, which means that every day the equivalent of USD 3.25 million goes to help athletes and sports organisations at all levels around the world.

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Recruiters And Company Hirers Work/think Vertically]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;A trend is occurring in the Sport where Executives and Board Members with no experience in sports administration are being appointed CEO&acirc;Äôs/GM&acirc;Äôs of Sport Organisations. Then on the other side of the spectrum Sport Administrators skills are not considered complementary in other industries! I&acirc;Äôve experienced this first hand. It is tough educating recruiters and organisations that sport administrators have skills that are transferable across many industries. Recruiters and company hirers work/think vertically. Why? Maybe it is because both the recruiter and the company hiring aren&acirc;Äôt as au fait with the competencies of Sports Administrators. Being in sport for a quite a few years, I&acirc;Äôve experienced this and it does cause some self-doubt and frustrations, but you learn to battle through (don&acirc;Äôt look back!). On the other hand some (note the word some) Board Members and Corporates consider themselves an easy transfer across to a sport organisation, but they don&acirc;Äôt understand the intricacies and machinations involved in operating a sport organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-post-image&quot; src=&quot;https://media3.cgtrader.com/variants/mx8eySWNefbN2ceJqor71VPX/9cae6891d5963582c5a024dd4cd2d77f44d540a2ca4f778b8c6afa6918049521/rend%202.jpg&quot; style='clear:both; float:right; padding:10px 0px 10px 10px; border:0px; max-width: 345px;'&gt;Sport organisations do use business principles, but they do differ, especially in the stakeholder department e.g. members supporters, players, coaches, staff, sponsors etc. They also differ in that revenue streams are far different and at times harder to come by and expenses need to be managed well and priorities need to be put in place. There is also a bit of &acirc;Äòsoul&acirc;Äô and the &acirc;Äòheart&acirc;Äô required to run a sport organisation. The same can be said for Executives coming from the corporate world! Because Board members are appointed at Executive management levels in sport organisations it could create an issue of lack of governance e.g. their mates appointed them therefore decision making can be compromised. The best candidate should be employed - offered the role on their merits. With the right person in the role, the sport organisation will operate well, grow and innovate and be a long-term sustainable business. The same goes for the corporate world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same way that child labour laws do not prevent weekend and casual work, like paperrounds or shop sales, most child and adolescent sport is not labour-like. 1) Working long hours - child athletes may start intensive training at a very young age. In a published excerpt from her book, Dokic reveals that her tennis became 24/7 during her adolescence, which meant sacrificing time with her mother and brother. 2) Working under excessive physical, psychological or social stress - there is evidence of this in rates of burnout, overuse injuries, and withdrawal from sport. Some children have excessively stressful experiences, turning sports loving children into drop-out adolescents and young adults. Dokic claimed that she considered suicide as an option of escape. 3) Working for little pay - very few child athletes are paid or subsidised and those that are may not be protected from unscrupulous parents or agents. Dokic&acirc;Äôs father referred to the youngster as the family&acirc;Äôs &acirc;Äúway out&acirc;Äù from a life of poverty and welfare in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dokic subsequently signed all of her earnings over to him. 4) Being subject to intimidation - there are multiple cases of young athletes reporting physical, mental and sexual abuse in elite and sub-elite programs. Dokic has revealed that she suffered belt-whippings, beatings, verbal abuse, kicking and spitting. Children, because of their vulnerability, need special care and protection. Abuse and exploitation in elite child and adolescent sport is far more widespread than it should be. Research has found emotional abuse of child athletes by their coaches became worse after the child was identified as an elite performer. The government might be motivated to apply child labour laws to limit child sport programs, based on compelling evidence of the harm that can be caused. That is that child athletes, like Dokic, suffer humiliation, abuse, injury, stress and burnout. The conditions of elite sport for children, even when in non-abusive situations, may remain work-like in some aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[The Evolution Of Man - The History Of Hunting]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one of the eldest activities on the face of the planet is hunting. The history of hunting, as a result, is also one of the most diverse. Hunting for food has always been something that human kind has had to do, dating back to the beginning of any civilizations known to man. As a result of this, there have been thousands of weapons and devices used to hunt. The history of hunting is far more complicated than any other history in the world, as it stretches so far into the past. In order to understand this history, you need to break down and study each era where hunting has been a major part of life. While there are exact time lines of when certain guns or weapons were produced, understanding the importance of hunting should be done on a far broader scale. There is much more to the history of hunting than when the gun was created. In this time frame, from before great cities to the first starts of basic civilization, the human race survived on their skills of scavenging and hunting.&lt;/p&gt;

Some portions of modern day Africa have conditions similar to this, where they do not have a great deal of money, and a similar style of hierarchy. The men all learned how to hunt, and they held these hunts daily to feed themselves. Unlike today, all hunting was for survival, and none of it for sport. All of the materials from the killed animals was used, from the bones to the pelt. Hunting was also a method of determining who was the bravest warrior. The bravest would hunt the ferocious creatures that lived nearby their homes. These kills were a vital part of the early hierarchies. A wide variety of different weapons were used during this era, from slings to spears crafted of wood and stone.&lt;/p&gt;

The only trophies kept were antlers and teeth. Occasionally the skulls would be kept as decoration or as symbols of the clan or family group. This oldest form of hunting was the basis in which the present was formed. As people gathered together and civilization really began, the role of men as hunters changed as well. Cities, by their very nature, require a variety of people with a lot of skills. There needed to be craftsmen and weavers, animal handlers and other trades so that everyone could have access to everything they needed. Instead of the split between men and women, hunting became the task of those most suited for hunting. These were usually always men, as it was looked down upon for women to participate in this line of work. This was also the turning point where hunting becoming a sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Civilizations, such as the Babylonians, the Egyptians, and the Romans all had their hunters and craftsmen. The Romans, took hunting as a sport to a whole new level, capturing prey alive for sale or gladiatorial competitions. Only certain individuals were hunters, allowing the select men to feed those in their community. Perhaps one of the most interesting times in the history of hunting, is the middle ages. This is the period in time where hunting for food was a vital part of life for many, though restricted. Rules on hunting, such as no hunting in the King's Forest, was the first real restrictions on hunting present in the world. Only the rich prospered, and the surf classes hunted whatever they could, when they could for survival. Hunting, from boar to deer to fox hunting, became primary sports for the nobility of the time frame. This started the trend of organized hunts for sport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it's the biggest event of your lifetime, shelling out a few bucks from your wallet won't hurt you at all; therefore you should do the maximum you can afford on this very special day for finding the elegance and style that you desire at the right price. People hire limo cars of different types depending on the number of passengers required to carry along with the couple. Most of the couples prefer riding the wedding car alone however in some parts of the world, it's a tradition that the bridge is accompanied by some of the family members such as sisters or relatives on the way to venue. For couples, the most economical and commonly used choice is a sedan limousine. It's a highly luxurious car which does not cost as much as other limousines. The maximum seating capacity of a sedan limousine is 3 excluding the chauffeur therefore it's the best choice for a couple to ride to their wedding venue. Since sedans are good for couple only, some people also hire SUV (sport utility vehicle) which is a larger and roomy vehicle. SUVs offer a highly comfortable seating capacity of up to 8 passengers therefore a bride and groom may be accompanied by their close friends or relatives as well during their ride to the venue. The corporate limo hire services are availed by corporate class people. These limousines consist of super class vehicles such as stretched sedans or stretched SUVs. The stretched vehicles are the most expensive and are a symbol of sheer status and wealth. They are very expensive even for hire and only corporate class people hire them for managing their travel requirements.

&lt;p&gt;Esports has evolved at a pace unmatched in any other sport. What took decades in football or baseball takes only years. 20 to 30 years. I think the future of esports involves tackling a few key areas: compelling content beyond game play, geo-affiliation strategy, growing revenue streams beyond current figures, and finding the best platforms to reach the optimal esports audience. Amid the exciting usage and penetration trends in esports, how does Riot think about growing the North American League of Legends league? It&acirc;Äôs our job to not only continue to deliver the value that keeps our core excited and energized, but to find ways to deliver value to new cohorts of fans to grow the audience and generate increased revenue for teams and players alike. We&acirc;Äôve also recently deepened our relationship with our game publishing team in North America to celebrate and highlight key moments in the publishing cycle-new champions, new game modes, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Adidas Is Giving Nike A Run For Its Money]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;A logo hangs on display outside a Nike Inc. store in Chicago, Illinois, U.S. Nike and Adidas are two of the largest footwear companies in the world. Effective marketing strategies and innovative products have helped these companies outperform the broader apparel industry over the last couple of years. Trefis captures trends in key operating metrics for Nike vs. Adidas in an interactive dashboard, highlighting how Adidas has been able to close the gap on the market leader over recent years through an increased marketing spend. Additionally, you can find more Trefis Textiles, Apparel and Luxury Good Industry Data here. However, Nike is notably bigger than second-placed Adidas. Nike&acirc;Äôs total revenue in 2018 stood at $39 billion - almost 50% more than Adidas&acirc;Äô $26 billion. This growth has been led by the apparel and footwear segment which have continued to achieve robust growth in the last couple of years driven by continued global trends such as increasing penetration of sportswear, rising sports participation rate, and increasing health awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/TNLevbx-Y6Q&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen title=&quot;10 People You&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although, Nike and Adidas have added roughly $7 billion to total since 2015, Adidas&acirc;Äôs growth has come at a 70% faster rate than Nike. Adidas&acirc;Äô growth has been led by its footwear segment which has continued to achieve double-digit growth driven by sales increases in sports-inspired and sport-performance products. However, both these apparel companies have continued to outperform the industry. Athletic footwear has continued to a be a strong driver for these companies, led by higher demand for various casual and running style. Adidas has comfortably outpaced Nike&acirc;Äôs growth in the last couple of years, with Adidas&acirc;Äô offerings such as Adidas Neo and Originals receiving positive customer response. Moreover, Adidas has been able to adapt itself better to changing customer tastes and preferences. However, there is still a huge gap between Nike&acirc;Äôs and Adidas&acirc;Äô footwear revenues. Adidas has been more aggressive in marketing its products. As of 2018, Adidas&acirc;Äô &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedrum.com/news/2019/05/14/5-the-biggest-sports-marketing-trends-2019&quot;&gt;marketing&lt;/a&gt; expenditure stood at $3.5 billion- representing roughly 14% of total revenues. On the other hand, Nike&acirc;Äôs marketing expenditure of $3.8 billion was higher than of Adidas but represented less than 10% of Nike&acirc;Äôs total revenues. How does Nike&acirc;Äôs Profitability compare to that of Adidas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 2018, Nike&acirc;Äôs net income of $4 billion was almost double Adidas&acirc;Äô $2 billion. Nike&acirc;Äôs market capitalization as of July 2019 stood at $140 billion - more than double to that of Adidas&acirc;Äô $65 billion. That said, both Adidas and Nike have expanded the scale and scope of their operations over time by adding new brands. They have also launched effective buzz marketing campaigns with both innovative products and celebrity endorsements and collaborations. Nike and Adidas have outperformed the other apparel, particularly, footwear companies in the past few years and we expect this trend to continue over the foreseeable future. Per Trefis, Nike is likely to report an EPS of $2.98 for the year. This EPS figure coupled with a P/E multiple of 30x, works out to a price estimate of $89 for Nike&acirc;Äôs stock (shows cash and valuation analysis), which is roughly 10% ahead of the current market price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 200 members of the Harvard community participated in the Cambridge City Walk/Run on April 1, raising more than $3,000 for the Friends of Cambridge Athletics, the Andrea Harvey Memorial Fund, and Cambridge Special Olympics. Ryan Neely, a research assistant at the Center for Brain Science at Harvard, was the winner with a time of 26:53:2, which translates to a 5:23 mile pace. And of course, many Harvardians will be running in the upcoming marathon. The five members of this years HCMC marathon team, who are running to benefit the Phillips Brooks House Association, have raised more than $18,000 of their $25,600 goal. &Acirc;ìI dont think its coincidental that marathons are charity events,&Acirc;î Lieberman said. A million years ago, he said, if we went running, wed likely be hunting. When our ancestors got back to camp, theyd be greeted by their community, and would present and distribute their spoils. Perhaps not much has changed since then, Lieberman said. &Acirc;ìRunning is about sharing,&Acirc;î he said. This story is published courtesy of the Harvard Gazette, Harvard University's official newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bamboo earring is a craze in today's world. Every fashionable woman is stocking a pair of it in her wardrobe. It has become a must have fashion accessory for every women. If you think that these jewelries are made from bamboo, you are wrong! Bamboo earring are typically made from gold. It's actually the hoops that are given the shape and markings of bamboo. However, don't be surprised if you come across an earring made from original bamboo. It is not that it is impossible to make original bamboo earrings; it is only that these jewelries must be provided with some kind of coating when made with original bamboo because that would keep the accessory in good condition. These jewelry pieces have simply marked a niche in the fashion industry. Now, the question that may come to your mind is that what is it that makes a bamboo earring so popular and trendy with the urban population.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[The 50 Most Stunning Olympic Moments]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;With the Olympics shunted into the future, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2020/07/27/the-total-woke-conquest-of-the-pro-sports-world/&quot;&gt;trend sport world&lt;/a&gt; Sportsmail sets off today on a long look at its storied past. Naturally, there is a hefty and unapologetic British bias among the memories. And equally there is attention to the scandals and mishaps and quirky tales, because the Olympics have always been about so much more than &acirc;Äòfaster, higher, stronger&acirc;Äô. At many junctures, &acirc;Äòsleazier, dirtier, weirder&acirc;Äô has been just as apt. The following days will see a nod to the wonderful and woeful elements that have made the Olympic Games what they are. And a reminder of what lies ahead. Starting with the good. The great, in fact. Mary Peters is one of those athletes whose accomplishments lifted her high above any step on any podium. She came to represent the brightest light of hope for Northern Ireland at the darkest point of its Troubles, sealed by winning pentathlon gold at Munich &acirc;Äô72 - the same year in which 479 lives were lost to the violence. Her adventure in reaching those Olympics had already been quite something - a real story for the era.&lt;/p&gt;

So what &lt;em&gt;trends&lt;/em&gt; should we expect to see in 2019? Esports sponsorship has&lt;wbr&gt; ...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an instance of life before Lottery funding, on her 16th birthday her father gave her two tons of sand to make a long jump pit. On her 17th he gave her a truck-load of cement to build a shot-put circle to go with the home-made hurdles. With the escalation of the Troubles, she would hear bombs going off around Belfast on her bus journeys to train and once three soldiers were murdered in a flat adjoining hers. She was celebrating at the British base when she heard the IRA had threatened to blow her up on her return. &acirc;Äô to that and went straight to Belfast, where she was carried through the city on an open-topped lorry. In noting how she set a trend for female British multi-sport stars including Jessica Ennis-Hill, she laughed when she told Sportsmail in 2017: &acirc;ÄòI wouldn&acirc;Äôt begrudge Jess or anyone else a penny of what they get but, when I won the Olympics, endorsements weren&acirc;Äôt the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&acirc;ÄòI did an ad for a building society. That was funny because a little later I wanted to buy a two-bedroom cottage outside Belfast, the one I still live in, so I went to them for a loan. They said no.&acirc;Äô Aged 80, she is still partying given any chance and has raised well over &Acirc;&pound;1million for young sportspeople through her foundation. From the great to the dumb. And perhaps one of the more surreal episodes in recent Games, given the saga that played out after the six-time Olympic champion gave an interview at Rio 2016 about being robbed at gunpoint. His claim was that men dressed as police held him up, along with three US swimming team-mates, and put a gun to his head. Police reports put forward a different version of events, namely that Lochte and his team-mates had trashed a restroom at a petrol station. Security, they said, then pulled their guns on the swimmers and demanded money. After developing into a major international incident, Lochte admitted exaggerating but was cleared of falsely communicating a crime. He lost his sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of the most remarkable and unfortunate scenarios in Olympic history, the little Italian led the 1908 marathon as he entered London&acirc;Äôs White City stadium. Alas, he turned left instead of right, and as the crowd informed him of the error, he collapsed in exhaustion. He would collapse a further four times in those final few hundred yards, the final tumble just ahead of the line, from where he was given help and dragged over. He finished first before his inevitable disqualification for receiving assistance. The writer Arthur Conan Doyle, who was there for the Daily Mail, later used the newspaper to raise a fund to help Pietri open a bakery. Britain had never won an Olympic gold medal in gymnastics and in the space of two hours at Rio 2016, a quiet 23-year-old from Hemel Hempstead won a pair of them. He had arrived in Brazil with hopes of &acirc;Äòsnatching&acirc;Äô a bronze in the floor before launching an assault on gold on the pommel horse against team-mate Louis Smith.&lt;/p&gt;

With technology taking over the world at a rapid pace, it is pretty obvious that the trend among kids would be fast depleting. However, it is high time that people started making an effort towards ensuring that the trend of outdoor activities is not completely lost among the younger generation. It is better to say that as responsible parents one should start to involve themselves in the fight to revive the ethics of outdoor activities among their children. Why put &lt;a href=&quot;https://websummit.com/stages/sports-trade&quot;&gt;in&lt;/a&gt; such an effort? The answer to this question lies in the fact that outdoor sports involving physical activity helps to ensure the all-round development of the child. This helps them at becoming active people and leads a healthy life in the coming years. Sports activities like skiing, cycling, football helps in active metabolism of the body that further ensure that the mind and the body remains active and fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It helps to promote better physical well-being since the body parts remain active and refrain from being ideally rigid. It forms a significant part of the mental development that is crucial during the initial ages of childhood. Without this mental development, one can expect that their child would be the ideal dull kid. Sticking to books increases knowledge, while gadgets make the kid efficient at handling complex machines, but the un-indulgence in sports make them unfit and extremely volatile to an unethical outlook during their later stages of life. Better to say that it makes them fat and grumpy as well. How can we avoid this? Helping the kids is easy and all that one has to do is buy them authentic sports requisites. Globber scooters and Grit scooters have been a huge success in the market. It is a reincarnation of the idealistic childhood, which many people generally dream of. For the skiing enthusiasts, the ideal requisites like the headgear, head ski boots, head skis, Heelys is the ideal option to make them smile. With standard quality assurance and lower maintenance ordeals, one can be assured that their experience with the sport is ought to be reincarnated to a considerable extent. Head ski helmets also form an integral part of the ideal skiing package to the people enthusiastic about the sport.&lt;/p&gt;

The one thing which baseball spawned however was a trend which will never be outgrown by the actual sport. It is used by people from all countries, young people, old people, even people who hate baseball. It is the baseball hat! Baseball hats were first used in 1860 by the Brooklyn Excelsior's baseball team. At the time every other team wore hats of all types or not at all. Ninety-Four years later by the New Era hat company the 59Fifty baseball hat became the officially designed and adopted hat for baseball players. They stayed on your head, and the bill kept the sun out of your eyes. They were the ultimate hat! Their practicality and usability for normal people for everyday life was quickly realised and the market spread far further than the baseball field and right across the United States of America and then worldwide. They are a hat for everybody, with the guy on the street wearing them and film stars and even the president. You would be hard-pressed to find one person on the planet who hasn't worn a baseball cap on at least one occasion. Baseball hats, although having millions of varieties and designs have never strayed too far from their original design and are the longest-running style hat ever. In a day and age where everything is constantly been bettered, we are yet to see a hat replace the baseball hat in both style and practicality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, like a third of Britons, you own a fitness tracker, you may already count your steps, track your sleep quality and keep a tally of calories consumed and expended. And, reasonably, you might also think that your daily data is comprehensive enough to keep ill health at bay. But those &acirc;Äòin the know&acirc;Äô are adding another measurement to their DIY wellness assessment: their heart rate variability, or HRV. Unlike plain heart rate - the number of beats per minute made by your heart - HRV determines the time between each beat, and how that varies. This is given as an overall HRV &acirc;Äòscore&acirc;Äô, which is a calculation based on just how much variation there is. A higher score, meaning greater variability, is the most desirable. A lower score, meaning less variability, may mean you&acirc;Äôve been exercising too hard - and you need a break. HRV has long been a parameter used by elite athletes seeking that extra physiological insight to give them the edge over rivals - allowing them to push their bodies to limits, without risking damage from over-training, which can harm the immune system and lead to injury.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class='wp-post-image' src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FCgSbdysmmE/hqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Maghalie Rochette - The GCN Cyclocross Podcast Ep.3 - &euml;èô&igrave;òÅ&igrave;ÉÅ&quot; style=&quot;clear:both; float:right; padding:10px 0px 10px 10px; border:0px; max-width: 355px;&quot;&gt;The ski world is seeing a major revamp this season, with more ski resorts being opened throughout the country, and more people heading for the slopes. A fantastic sport to get your blood pumping, skiing is adored by many, with well known faces such as Kate Moss and Prince William being regular participants. The days of dull and drab ski wear has long passed, and we are now seeing the seasons fashion trends make there mark on the slopes. One of the main trends for ski wear this season, is bright, eye catching colours. The rule is the brighter the better, so be brave and bold this year, with yellows, lime, hot pink, greens and blues. You can also try the 'colour blocking' trend with your ski wear, and mix up different colours with your jacket and ski pants. If you would rather be a bit more subtle with your look, wear ski masks which incorporate a bright colour, or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A simple, crisp white colour will also keep your look fashionable this season. Some of the key trends for autumn/winter 2010, such as animal prints and military fashion, are being replicated for ski wear fashion, so you can look chic and fabulous on the slopes. Create a feminine look by wearing a belt with your winter ski jacket. Stretch fabrics are also very stylish for ski wear this season. To keep yourself warm and stylish on the slopes, wear a 3-in-1 ladies ski jacket, in a bright, vivacious colour. These types of jacket have an inner insulation, such as a fleece jacket, which you can remove at any time, and an outer layer which will protect you against the cold weather and snow. Wear it fitted to create a more feminine and flattering silhouette. A fur vest under your jacket, will create an extra layer for protection from the cold.

&lt;p&gt;It's not sport as we know it, but UFC 249 gave fans and athletes an insight into how the world of mixed martial arts will look in the short term, and you'd be forgiven for thinking it's all slightly mad. The controversial event, which took place at an empty VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena in Jacksonville, Florida, gave fans never-before-seen insight into the sport with everyone but a small section of the media, the fighters and UFC staff permitted in the arena. The UFC is renowned for its vociferous fans that regularly sell out arenas to catch a glimpse of their favourite fighters in action across the United States and the world. Understandably, given the threat of the spread of the deadly coronavirus, fans won't be allowed to attend sporting events for some time, and on Saturday it made for an eerie atmosphere in Jacksonville. Fans ride the wave of the action like thrill seekers approaching the peak of a rollercoaster, energised by the build up and anticipation, before crashing down and hanging on tight through every hook, takedown and submission attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fighters, too, feed off that energy. UFC 249's main event, which saw Justin Gaethje defeat Tony Ferguson to claim the interim lightweight title, saw such ferocious, spine-tingling shots thrown by both men that would have elicited countless ooos and aaas from fans had they been in attendance. The fight itself was deserving of an audience to express their appreciation. Instead, sat at home, those fans could hear EVERYTHING. The terrifying sound of one fighter's padded glove crunching into the other's jaw, the light skipping of an athlete on the canvas and the barking of instructions from each corner. It was a compelling watch for those viewing from home. That novelty will surely wear off in &lt;a HREF=&quot;https://www.tokopedia.com/onilneshop/jam-tangan-seiko-5-srp127k1-sport-world-time-silver-black-original&quot;&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;, and won't mask the fact that the fans play such a crucial role in every UFC event. Most fighters will want them back sharpish to give them that much-needed extra boost. In the meantime, UFC 249 saw some fighters benefit greatly from there being no fans in the stands for one rather peculiar reason. Jacksonville is not New York City or Las Vegas, but the UFC ensured that it had its all-star commentators in place on Saturday night's action.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[The Fashion Faux Pas In Wearing Argyle Sweater Vests]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Argyle sweater vests are stylish pieces of clothing that has been considered as an unfading trend that has surpassed many, many decades. Men from all over the world love to sport this article of clothing because it can be worn to casual get-togethers and even to formal gatherings by just replacing the other garments paired with it to either more laid back pieces or to more sophisticated apparel. However, there are still some no-no's when it comes to wearing this trend. Not knowing about these would run the risk of you becoming a walking eye strain. So if you want to avoid any chance of looking unintelligent and physically unattractive, read along and find out the fashion faux pas in wearing sweater vests with those famous diamond-shaped patterns. First and foremost, it is essential for you to remember that argyle should only be worn on one half of your body, and that is the top half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're sweater vest, or any other top you have on for that matter, already has an argyle pattern, then do not even think about looking for a pair of argyle pants to wear with it. Although you could wear argyle socks with the former, it is never a good idea to wear an argyle top with an argyle bottom. As a matter of fact, pants with an argyle design are social blunders. So if you want to walk around while people constantly whisper about your fashion sense and laugh behind your back while giving you weird looks, then go ahead and find a pair of argyle pants to wear proudly to any of your choice destinations. Otherwise, stay on the safe side and of the fashion spectrum and stick to argyle sweaters and the like. The next big no-no to wearing argyle sweater vests is pairing it with an undershirt that also has a pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is true for whether you are sporting a casual look or if you're attire something that is more formal. If your tee is already striped, checkered, plaid or printed, then it will only be at odds with a sweater vest that also has a pattern on it. So either change it or keep your argyle in the closet for now. The same goes for button-up shirts, coats and ties. Whether the print is just pinstripes or subtle polka dots, they are still unacceptable partners to articles of clothing with an argyle pattern. Lastly, never pair the garment in question with undershirts that are shabby and frayed. Even if you want to look casual, this is not advisable. Now you know the top fashion faux pas when it comes to wearing argyle sweater vests. May you never commit them and may you always be wise in choosing whatever you wear.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Female Gymnasts Who Made Olympic History - Gymnastics]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The sport of gymnastics not only requires physical strength, flexibility, agility, coordination, balance, and grace, it also requires a high level of passion for the sport. Throughout Olympic history there have been several women who have stood out above the rest, mastering artistic gymnastics in events like the uneven parallel bars, balance beam, floor exercise, and vault. Their competitive spirit and athletic achievements have gained them a place in the record books as the best gymnasts in the world. Olga Valentinovna Korbut is a Soviet-born gymnast who won a total of four gold medals and two silver medals while representing the USSR team during the 1972 and 1976 Summer Olympics. Known for her talented acrobatics and open displays of emotion during her routines, she became one of the first gymnasts to ever do a backward somersault on the balance beam in competition. Olga also performed a skill known as the Korbut Flip on the uneven bars where from a stand on the high bar, the gymnast performs a back flip and regrasps the bar. Korbut amazed audiences with this routine at the 1972 Summer Olympics, the first time it was performed on the uneven bars in international competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center; clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her 1972 Olympic debut was so memorable that it caused many young girls to join their local gymnastic clubs and take up the sport. Her focus on acrobatics rather than on elegance also reversed the trend of the way athletes performed their routines. In 1988 Korbut was the first gymnast to be inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame. Nadia Elena Comaneci is one of the best known gymnasts in the world. She received three gold medals at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, as a member of the Romanian team. In 1970 she became the youngest gymnast ever to win the Romanian Nationals. She won her first all-around title in 1971 when she participated in her first international competition that also won her team the gold. At the age of 11 she won the all-around gold at the Junior Friendship Tournament in 1973. By age 13 she won the all-around gold medal on every event except the floor exercise at the 1975 European Championships in Skien, Norway. It was at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal where 14-year-old Comaneci became a shining star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her routine on the uneven bars was scored a perfect 10.0, the first time in modern Olympic gymnastics history that the score had ever been awarded. By the end of the Olympics, Nadia had earned six more perfect ten scores capturing the all-around, beam, and bars titles and a bronze medal on the floor exercise. In addition to being inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame, Nadia also received the Olympic Order, the highest award given by the International Olympic Committee. She received the award in 1984 and 2004 making her the only person (and the youngest) to receive this honor twice. Inspired by watching Nadia Comaneci on television, Mary Lou Retton took up gymnastics in her hometown of Fairmont, West Virginia. She then moved to Houston, Texas to train under Romanian coaches Bela and Marta Karolyi, Nadia's former coaches. Retton won the American Cup in 1983 and the American Classic in 1983 and 1984. She also won Japan's Chunichi Cup in 1983. Gymnastics at the time was completely dominated by Eastern European gymnasts. Mary Lou Retton was the first gymnast outside Eastern Europe to win the Olympic all-around title during the 1984 Summer Olympics. She also won two silver and two bronze medals. Her performance during the Games earned her Sports Illustrated magazine's Sportswoman of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;

This will help you save a considerable amount of money by reducing the heating bills by a high margin. Such things will also help you contribute towards the environment, and make the dress an eco-friendly one. Approve it or deny it, Onesie costumes are one of the coolest dresses the fashion world has ever seen. Being available in various designs including cute animals, Pokemon and several others are available, from which, people can buy according to their choice.

&lt;p&gt;There was a time when wearing heavy jewellery was the norm. But today, the scenario has changed with time.People do not want to wear jewellery for the sake of wearing it but want them to have some meaning, some significance in their lives. In this regard, Fingerprint Jewellery is different and fulfils the criteria perfectly. Pastel Print is a company which deals with such product and is one of the leading companies in this genre in the UK market.The fingerprint necklace is something which is extremely beautiful, smart, sophisticated and consists of finger prints of your little ones or of the people whom you love. Wearing a fingerprint bracelet is a new trend in the world of fashion. Unlike the world of fashion, there are a very few trends in jewellery and they tend to be everlasting. Not all the sections of the society follow the trend. The generation of today does not believe in wearing chunky or heavy jewellery but instead would not think twice before investing in a keepsake like Fingerprint Necklace. It is one of the fine ways of keeping the imprints of your loved ones close to you by wearing them on your body.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background:rgba(0,0,0,0.1);padding:0px 10px 1px 10px;border-radius:5px;border:1px solid #000;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nielsen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Nielsen_Top5_Commercial_Trends_2018.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;top 5 global sports industry trends - Nielsen&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;cite&gt;www.nielsen.com&lt;span class=&quot;eipWBe&quot;&gt; &acirc;Ä&ordm; 2019/04&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;color:rgba(0,0,0,0.6);&quot;&gt;When we first sat down to discuss the &lt;em&gt;trends&lt;/em&gt; affecting the &lt;em&gt;sports&lt;/em&gt; business in 2018&lt;wbr&gt;, it was clear that the most significant of these had been with us for some years.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center; clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.stocksnap.io/img-thumbs/960w/IV3RNXQ98G.jpg&quot; class=&quot;wp-post-image&quot; style='max-width: 380px;'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Worryingly, it also predicts that &quot;obese&quot; is likely to become the new norm. The number of overweight or obese infants and young children increased from 32m globally in 1990 to 41m in 2016. The vast majority of overweight or obese children live in developing countries, where the rate of increase has been more than 30% higher than that of developed countries. Efforts to reverse this growing trend have mainly focused on two aspects of a child's life: diet and physical activity. The aim has been to try and regulate a child's dietary habits by decreasing calorific intake. This is most commonly through the reduction in sugar, while at the same time boosting the amount of exercise children get. But what is often ignored is a child's ability to move effectively. It is one thing to say that a child should be more physically active, but quite another for a child to develop the competence and confidence required to engage in physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most adults tend to think this is something that will happen naturally as part of child's development - through play and sports participation. But because of the way the world has changed over recent decades - think less time for running around outside and more time inside looking at screens - opportunities for children to move are in decline. In this way, a child's &quot;play radius&quot; - the distance a child travels from their home to play - has shrunk by 90% in a single generation. A decrease in walking and an increase in transport by car, train or bus also limits children's opportunities to play. Combine this with the lack of specialist physical ed &acirc;Ä&brvbar; Effective movement for children in the early stages of development, (roughly four to seven years of age) can be assessed by their ability to perform fundamental movement skills. This includes how they run, catch, throw and balance. These skills are often viewed as the building blocks for participation in &lt;A href=&quot;https://www.pwc.ch/en/insights/sport/sports-survey-2018.html&quot;&gt;sport&lt;/A&gt; and physical activity. And there is growing evidence that supports the positive relationship between &quot;movement competence&quot; and physical activity in early childhood - showing the importance of appropriate movement skills for children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that the &quot;movement competence&quot; of four to seven year-olds, in the UK, is average or below average in relation to their peers in most other countries, which, alongside childhood obesity levels, clearly indicates the UK's poor standing in children's health. But one glimmer of hope comes from a new movement assessment app called Start to Move. The app is based on an assessment tool that enables primary school teachers - who are well placed to spot these skills - to measure, record and track the fundamental movement skills of children aged four to seven years old. And this data can then be used to help policymakers and practitioners alike recognise what support is needed to ensure all children have appropriate movement skills. This is important because although findings from previous research studies are useful in providing a snapshot of children's &quot;movement competence&quot; only a very small number of children have been measured. So a more widespread understanding of children's movement is a positive next step - particularly as we stand, globally, on the brink of a situation where &quot;obese&quot; will be more common than &quot;underweight&quot;. It is crucial then that every solution available is looked into to reverse this worrying trend, because it is clear that current methods are falling short in many places. But ultimately this is about more than just the figures and obesity rates, this is about making sure the next generation of adults are suitably prepared for a sustainable active lifestyle.

					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;img style='max-width: 380px;' alt=&quot;Bugatti Grand Sport Vitesse Top Speed! Plus GT-R vs R8 and Corvette C7 - Wide Open Throttle Ep. 67 - &euml;èô&igrave;òÅ&igrave;ÉÅ&quot; src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LbX52Fm5goA/hqdefault.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Knowing the latest tennis trends can help you understand the significance of the game and how it has changed throughout the years. Tennis continues to be one of the most popular sports in the world since it was popularized in the twelfth century in Northern France, where its initial forms were played. One of its earliest forms known as 'Game of the Palm' (Jeu de Paume) was played by France's King Louis X, and the pastime became widely recognized and practiced among Europe's aristocrats. This 2017, tennis is expected to continue becoming popular for new and experienced players alike. The sport reportedly had a billion fans from around the world in 2016. For those who are thinking of taking up tennis for any reason, 2017 can be the best year for learning this sport, with so many new tennis rackets and fashionable clothing being released. Some of the most significant trends in tennis came about because of the advancements in tennis racket technology-and this is not likely to change. This 2017, more emphasis is expected to be placed on the player's play style and skill level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Racket manufacturers are catching on to this trend as they continue to produce higher-quality rackets that are lightweight, more aerodynamic and balanced, and less bulky. The latest tennis trends in fashion are expected to be showcased by popular players in championship matches. In men's tennis, there is a trend of matching the colors of socks to the tennis shoes. Black or white socks used to be the norm, but some players have begun adding pops of color to their outfits. Another trend in men's tennis is the double wide wristbands, which are three inches longer than the standard. Arm sleeves have become trendy on the court, too. They are used to be worn to remedy arm pain or for sun cover, but there are players who coordinate them with their outfits. Showing more skin seems to be another emerging trend in tennis fashion. More and more male tennis players are expected to wear sleeveless shirts, and we might see a lot of bare midriffs on the ladies.&lt;/p&gt;

So what &lt;em&gt;trends&lt;/em&gt; should we expect to see in 2019? Esports sponsorship has&lt;wbr&gt; ...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And guess what? Those people need to eat, and they need places to stay (probably a good souvenir, too). That means more money to hotels, restaurants, sports facilities, and gift-shops alike. Sports tourism is a vast international business attracting investment, political interest, media attention and thousands of traveling participants and spectators. Cities and nations wager millions to stage sporting events such as a World Cup, the Olympics or the UEFA Champions League Final. In return, cities expect millions more from sponsors, developers and visitors. The estimated size of the global sport industry is $1.7 trillion (Plunkett Research Group). So Sport is big business and people are travelling a lot. Around 1.8 billion international tourists are expected to travel by 2030 (international tourist arrivals grew 6% in 2018 UNWTO). According to the National Association of Sports Commissions (NASC, 2015), visitor spending associated with sport tourism in the United States was $8.96 billion, with 25.65 million sport visitors. Furthermore, sport tourism accounts for 25% of all tourism receipts, rising to as much as 55% in Australia and parts of New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

World economic situation since 2007/2008 has put an extra pressure on people&acirc;Äôs psycho-physical state of health. People are increasingly looking forward to new ways of relaxation and re-energizing themselves. Some modes of tourism, globally, due to the economic downturn, have slowed down, but the tourism sector itself has done remarkably well during the last two-three years by offering the new model i.e. facility generally called Wellness. Within tourism, wellness is relatively a new trend that has registered an impressive growth rate (twice growth from general tourism). World-wide more and more people are traveling to destinations that provide wellness facilities. A recent study says that international wellness travellers spend around 65 per cent more than regular travellers, with top source countries currently Europe and North America, with growth expected to be driven by Asia, the Middle East and Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Yamaha's Kevin Curtain's retirement from active racing does not take the adrenalin away from a sport that has younger talents aspiring to cut a slice from the legacy that it is. Australia's Kevin Curtain, former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jd.id/product/casio-baby-g-world-time-ba-120kt-7ajr-sport-trend-women-s-watch-46mm_51879296/504221986.html&quot;&gt;world&lt;/a&gt; number two, in the 600cc Super sport category, has taken the legacy forward for the brand through the years and across numerous competitive Yamaha-led motorbike rallies. Thriving on the legacy are online retailers of Yamaha motorbike, OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturers) and Yamaha accessories. A brand transcending generations, motorbikes carry a legacy forward with its old and new models; be it the MX Competition models, the Enduro, trail bike models, adventure models or the agricultural models. These off-road products are as popular as the motor rallies they present in different categories.

&lt;p&gt;Given the expanding influence of gaming across entertainment and culture, how does Riot view gaming&acirc;Äôs growing presence? Is League of Legends (LoL) bigger than PC gaming? How does Riot view its business in terms of entertainment and world building? Riot has always viewed the IP being created around Summoner&acirc;Äôs Rift and our champions as something worth protecting and developing. Late last year, we announced a partnership with Marvel to create comics around one of our most popular champions. Our expansions into merchandise, music, and even board games are supplements to the game itself-they extend the ability our players and fans have to immerse themselves in our universe, and we believe that doing so will bring them back to the core game itself. Similarly, we see esports as a means of growing the ecosystem through a product of stand-alone value; the millions of fans who tune in weekly for our competitions are a testament to the value we&acirc;Äôve created with LoL esports. How does Riot weigh the tradeoffs of creating potential partnerships (such as broadcasting or original content deals) with traditional media companies who might want to gain leverage to gaming growth and consumers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;League of Legends is a PC-only game that requires an internet connection. We are still quite early when it comes to designing content for individual channels, but we certainly see the value of creating partnerships to bring not only our existing content, but potentially new content to a wider audience. How can Riot use professional players to grow its business, beyond sponsorship and event opportunities? Pro players are the core of our esports business. Our leagues tend to be star-driven-you can see the cohorts of fans that shift team allegiances when star players like Doublelift or Aphromoo transfer organizations. As such, they are critical to our success, both in fan engagement and in putting on the competitive product. It&acirc;Äôs no coincidence that we&acirc;Äôve started to center more competitive storylines around the players themselves. Fans resonated deeply with this story; they have been cheering for these players for years, and seeing a moment of such magnitude being highlighted so specifically allowed for easy engagement and excitement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will continue to use players across all channels of the business, but we always want to make sure we are not overextending them, given their rigorous practice schedule. What is the future of Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) versus Battle Royale? In general, how does Riot view esports evolving in the next three to five years? I look at MOBA versus Battle Royale like baseball versus football-they are two independent sports. It&acirc;Äôs not unusual for kids to play several sports growing up, but they will eventually specialize if they hope to &acirc;Äúgo pro.&acirc;Äù Esports and gaming are no different; we don&acirc;Äôt expect League players to not play top titles like Fortnite or the new Call of Duty, but we do hope we&acirc;Äôve built a game that they will come back to time after time. Similarly, we don&acirc;Äôt expect our LoL esports pros to be tempted to switch over to Apex Legends or AutoChess simply because the mastery they&acirc;Äôve developed in the League is valuable. Switching their significant focus to another game runs the risk of being left behind in LoL, and that is simply an economic decision most pros won&acirc;Äôt make.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[The Fair And Lovely Faces Of Cricket - Cricket]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style='clear:both; float:left; padding:10px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px; max-width: 390px;' alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media2.cgtrader.com/variants/eeAxpVTGqLhaDmrzNpPQDXnu/9cae6891d5963582c5a024dd4cd2d77f44d540a2ca4f778b8c6afa6918049521/1.jpg&quot; class='wp-post-image'&gt;Though Hockey is the national sport of India but the fact is that the Indians are crazy about cricket. Be it the World Cup or IPL matches, all the busy roads suddenly get deadly silence and people suddenly start getting sick to avail leaves just to watch these games. If cricket is our passion then cricketers are of course our heroes and Indian advertising companies are cashing on the popularity of the cricketers. Making cricketer a brand ambassador for a product has become an important marketing strategy. About 30 % of all the advertisements you watch on television are endorsed by these celebrity cricketers. 30 % of them go to top models, 30 percent to Bollywood stars and a few to other known athletes or sportspersons like Sania Nehwal and Vijendra Singh, and the remaining 10 percent feature budding models. Most of the Indian males are associated with cricket and this fact makes sense in using their names for brand promotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most renowned faces of the cricket fraternity that we usually see in television commercials are Sachin Tendulkar, Mahendra Singh Dhoni and the latest to join these stalwarts is Virat Kohli. Sachin is not only the most popular sportsperson for a very long time but he is also one of the most earning individual in the field of advertising for last 20 years. Till now Sachin Tendulkar has endorsed more than 100 brands and he still is appearing in a good number of advertisements. Buy cricket celebrity images to know more about this trend of marketing in India. The second most popular name among the cricketers who endorse a number of brands on television and earn a big buck is Mahendra Singh Dhoni. He became a star in the world of cricket in 2008 and outshined Sachin in brand endorsements. The reason behind his huge success is that at first place he is a very successful captain of Indian cricket team and secondly his good looks and physique make him a popular choice for the viewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present he is endorsing twenty three brands while the number of brands that Sachin Tendulkar is promoting are just seventeen, still a good number for a veteran like Sachin. Recently appointed Indian vice Captain Virat Kohli is the latest name to join the field of advertisements. This guy has got everything that an advertising company wants from its model. He is good looking, young, has got the attitude and is in a much respected position in Indian cricket team. He has become a &quot;fair and lovely&quot; face of cricket in the world of Indian advertising and is enjoying it really very much. Just a year ago he was signing the deals of Rs 1 Crore but today his rate has reached to about three times of the previous rates and companies are finding these rates worth as well. Virat appeals the current generation of India, the girls and the cricket fans as well. Unlike some of the cricketers like Sahwag and Saurav Ganguly, he acts like a born actor as well. His hands are already full with commercials and still many more are in the queue to have his signatures on the dotted line. He seems to give Sachin and Dhoni a tough competition in the field of brand endorsements and is surely going to be a default choice after these two stalwarts for the brand managers in future.&lt;/p&gt;

Building the LCS in North America was one of the largest steps in the evolution of esports over the last decade, and we will be continuing to innovate as we grow the league for years to come. Note: Mr. Hopper&acirc;Äôs participation in this article is for educational purposes only based on his knowledge of the subject, and the views expressed by him are solely his own. What does it mean for companies? The growth of mobile gaming is expanding the gamer user base and could provide opportunities for Telecom, Media &amp; Entertainment (TM&amp;E) companies, by opening cheaper and easier access to gaming markets. There could be more potential to enter the video gaming market. TM&amp;E companies could offer existing customers extra entertainment services, in the form of video gaming-related products and services, and also help their partner brands find new advertising markets. A key behavioral trend across media and entertainment consumption is that consumers are more actively building their own collection of services and tailoring their own entertainment experience, which increasingly includes options outside traditional forms of entertainment. TM&amp;E companies could build strategies that acknowledge the expanding presence and relevance of video gaming, especially among younger generations. The gaming penetration level among millennials is higher than Pay TV penetration, an indication that younger adults are less likely to be satisfied with traditional entertainment choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first ever global trends for adolescent insufficient physical activity show that urgent action is needed to increase physical activity levels in girls and boys aged 11 to 17 years. The study, published in The Lancet Child &amp; Adolescent Health journal and produced by researchers from the World Health Organization (WHO), finds that more than 80% of school-going adolescents globally did not meet current recommendations of at least one hour of physical activity per day - including 85% of girls and 78% of boys. The study - which is based on data reported by 1.6 million 11 to 17-year-old students - finds that across all 146 countries studied between 2001-2016 girls were less active than boys in all but four (Tonga, Samoa, Afghanistan and Zambia). The difference in the proportion of boys and girls meeting the recommendations was greater than 10 percentage points in almost one in three countries in 2016 (29%, 43 of 146 countries), with the biggest gaps seen in the United States of America and Ireland (more than 15 percentage points). The authors say that levels of insufficient physical activity in adolescents continue to be extremely high, compromising their current and future health.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Is Marriage Good Or Bad For The Figure?]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Numerous studies have shown that marriage is good for your health. As a team of researchers from Basel, Nuremberg, and Berlin have now found, however, that does not apply to all health indicators. Their findings show that married couples on average eat better than singles, but that they also weigh significantly more and do less sport. The researchers compared the relationship between marital status and body mass index, which relates body weight to height. A high body mass index can be a risk factor for chronic illnesses such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease. The researchers drew on representative cross-sectional data from 10,226 respondents in Austria, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Their study is the first to compare the relationship between marital status and body mass index in nine European countries. Beyond their focus on married couples, the researchers conducted additional analyses with cohabiting couples. They also examined possible reasons for weight gain by asking respondents about their eating and exercise behaviors. Findings from all nine countries showed that couples have a higher body mass index than singles - whether men or women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background:rgba(0,0,0,0.1);padding:0px 10px 1px 10px;border-radius:5px;border:1px solid #000;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.trendhunter.com/slideshow/2019-sports-trends&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Top 100 Sports Trends in 2019 - Trend Hunter&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;cite&gt;www.trendhunter.com&lt;span class=&quot;eipWBe&quot;&gt; &acirc;Ä&ordm; 2019...&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;color:rgba(0,0,0,0.6);&quot;&gt;2019 &lt;em&gt;sports trends&lt;/em&gt; - The expansive list of 2019 &lt;em&gt;sports trends&lt;/em&gt; highlight a plethora of ways of athleticism, creating products, services, and experiences that make ...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-post-image&quot; alt=&quot;Be a Sport in the Trendy Sports Wear for Women Project Desir&quot; src=&quot;http://projectdesires.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rBVaWVzU9oeANqTRAAFQwIURgh8353.jpg&quot; style='clear:both; float:right; padding:10px 0px 10px 10px; border:0px; max-width: 345px;' /&gt;The differences between countries were surprisingly small. According to the World Health Organization, a normal body mass index is between 18.5 and 25. Overweight is defined as an index between 25 and 30, and obesity as above 30. The average body mass index of the single men in the study was 25.7; that of the married men was 26.3. For women, the average index was 25.1 for singles and 25.6 for married women. Although these differences may seem small, they are meaningful. In an average-height woman of 165 cm or an average-height man of 180 cm, they represent a difference of about 2 kg. Importantly, the effects of socio-economic status, age, and nationality are already taken into account in these results. Ralph Hertwig, Director of the Center for Adaptive Rationality at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin. Survey findings on respondents' eating and exercise behaviors offered possible reasons for this trend. For example, couples reported buying more regional and unprocessed products and less convenience food. Moreover, married men were more likely than single men to buy organic and fair trade food. Jutta Mata, lead author of the study and Assistant Professor of Health Psychology at the University of Basel. But it does not mean that they are generally healthier: The study also shows that married men do less sport than singles. The respondents were asked about their eating and exercise behaviors and attitudes in face-to-face interviews. This approach ensures higher data quality: People's self-reports, for example of their weight, are more realistic if they are asked in person rather than, for example, by telephone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such activity creates a proximity between the sports stars and their fans and an opportunity for relevant brands to authentically sponsor the action. Sports teams are also able to leverage the social accounts of their top talent to boost engagement with their brand. Using the example of FC Barcelona, their Instagram following at 70 million is dwarfed by the 118m followers of its biggest star, Lionel Messi. Yet using their biggest footballing star in the role of authentic influencer, the club is able to promote the team as a whole, and the work they do. There has been a migration in the sports industry towards cause marketing, seeing big names and personalities using their authority to raise awareness of important issues. In 2018, former Manchester United star Rio Ferdinand and friend Jamie Moralee teamed up with mental health charity Calm (Campaign Against Living Miserably) to dispel harmful attitudes around men&acirc;Äôs mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing up to typical alpha male banter, the footballers answer questions like &acirc;Äúwho would win in a fight? &acirc;Äù and &acirc;Äúwho can drink the most? &acirc;Äù before getting more personal about the importance of their friendship. By openly discussing their feelings and need for support, Ferdinand and Moralee were perfect ambassadors for the charity and helped to dismantle the traditional masculine stereotype. Moreover, Sport England&acirc;Äôs groundbreaking 2015 campaign, &acirc;ÄòThe Girl Can&acirc;Äô, was responsible for encouraging women to get more involved in sports. The minute-and-a-half spot features everyday women partaking in their fitness routines set to Missy Elliot&acirc;Äôs &acirc;ÄòGet Your Freak On&acirc;Äô. Rather than focusing on glamorous, impossibly fit women that create an intimidating culture in sport for the unfit among us, the ad homes in on the elements of exercise that are less than flattering - the sweat, the hard work - and celebrates them anyway. Similarly, it&acirc;Äôs important for brands to create narratives that both resonate with and involve their target audiences. A strong example of brand storytelling comes from Nike&acirc;Äôs &acirc;ÄòWe won it in France&acirc;Äô spot for the French national team, after they won the 2018 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launching the club&acirc;Äôs latest strip, Nike celebrated the hard work of the French team and its players by drawing on their impoverished backgrounds in the banlieues of Paris and arid pitches of Marseille. This ad was a love letter not only to the players but to the supporters and their country, interweaving their stories with that of the club. In recent years the popularity of eSports has seen exponential growth, a fact which has not been missed by sports teams. In particular, the format has proven popular with football teams with so many millions of their fanbase regularly playing Fifa videogames. Spanish football team Real Madrid recently released plans for their updated, high-tech new home stadium which will include an eSports arena for fans. This is not dissimilar to plans from Tottenham Hotspur to host eSports tournaments when its new stadium is completed. The club thinks it will be able to earn upwards of &Acirc;&pound;3m for every non-footballing event, due to its 60,000-seat capacity. This is not the first time that Spurs have shown the club&acirc;Äôs belief in the power of eSports. At the end of 2018, the club was one of 20 Premier League teams that launched a competition among their fans, offering winners the opportunity to compete for and represent their favorite team in the ePremier League, a competitive video gaming event. Christian Fuchs, a Premier League winner with Leicester City, is working on his own eSports venture called &acirc;ÄòNoFuchsGiven&acirc;Äô. &acirc;ÄúOne of my big goals right now and I&acirc;Äôm in talks with several partners is that I will build an eSports arena in New York,&acirc;Äù Forbes quotes Fuchs as telling the SportsPro Live 2019 conference. &acirc;ÄúI just purchased 36 acres, there are about 70 buildings on there. Such significant investment suggests eSports will continue to be one of the dominant trends in real sports for years to come.

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Going Viral: Sport's Winners And Losers From COVID-19]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;It's March and as the coronavirus halts global sport, the media team at Juventus, the Italian football champions, are scrambling to react. After close discussions between Turin and their satellite office in Hong Kong, a plan emerges: tailored social media campaigns, targeting different countries, to keep locked-down fans engaged even when there are no live games. The result was a record rise in followers, including a marked uptick in China -- a triumph for the club in trying times, and a lesson for others who may have neglected their digital profile. Federico Palomba, Juventus's managing director for Asia-Pacific, told AFP at their office in Hong Kong. As professional sport, including Italian football, tentatively returns, the shutdown has revealed winners and losers in the digital sphere, and laid bare the importance of a strong online presence. In a world where sponsors and broadcasters demand evidence of a large, engaged fanbase, and where sport is competing with myriad entertainment options, winning on the pitch is no longer enough, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melissa Johnson Morgan, associate professor at the University of Southern Queensland's School of Management and Enterprise, said the traditional model of relying on revenues from ticket sales, broadcasters and sponsors is outdated. Top of the class is the NBA, which mobilised a flood of game footage, talk shows and Q&amp;A sessions with players, and capitalised on Netflix's release of Michael Jordan's &quot;The Last Dance&quot; series -- a big hit with live sports-starved fans. Formula One had drivers compete in virtual races, tennis players and cricketers popped up in a variety of online conversations, while golfer Adam Scott's &quot;Nine holes with a mate&quot; was a hit on Instagram. Other sports fared less well. Johnson Morgan said Australia's favourite competitions were among those that failed to engage fans, perhaps because administrators were preoccupied with restarting play. The coronavirus could force sports to look at more sophisticated ways to attract fans, after lockdown accelerated the trend towards 24-hour, on-demand entertainment. Palomba said Juventus had worked hard at diversifying in recent years, creating a retail division and ramping up branding. Juventus's stadium in Turin is flanked by the 'J-Village', which has a hotel, museum, training facility, eSports arena, and even a college and medical centre. The Italian club is also exploring working with China to help build the &quot;thousands of sports facilities&quot; expected to spring up in the country, he said. Erica Gao, who fronts Juventus's digital media in Asia-Pacific, said knowing your market was key. Specialised content for China has included a Mandarin-language game show and a campaign on May 20 -- an informal Valentine's Day for young Chinese. Paloma -- who, like NBA commissioner Adam Silver, has a background in media production -- said the convulsions caused by the coronavirus could shake up the way clubs handle their business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/EUaqsAdLCZ8?rel=0&amp;modestbranding=1&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen title=&quot;22 hours ago (c) by pluralsight&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data insights company Kantar warns of the impending &quot;digital paradox&quot; in which the sheer number of digital touchpoints will make it increasingly tricky for media owners and advertisers to connect with consumers. North America led the emerging cloud gaming market in 2019, according to research by Technavio. What's more, the global market is expected to grow by $2.7 billion from 2020 to 2024, based on the increasing popularity of service-oriented architecture (SOA), 5G technology, and a rising awareness about esports tournaments. Google's Stadia launch in November 2019 was successful enough for the company to move to Phase 2 and announce that it's on track to introduce more than 120 new games, a 4K service, support for more Android phones (it's currently only available on Google Pixels), and wireless game play on the web via the Stadia controller (you currently have to plug in a cable). High dynamic range (HDR), 4K, and 5.1 surround sound are currently only supported on Chromecast Ultra and require an active Stadia Pro subscription ($9.99 a month), according to Google. Being able to play without lags or interruptions is paramount to gamers, and flawed internet connections could cause frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet speed will also determine how rich in-game graphics can be. Even if you've signed up for an internet plan of 10Mbps or greater, Google recommends testing your connection on the device. Google's move forced Sony to halve the price of its PlayStation Now cloud video game service to $10 monthly. Microsoft has been testing Project xCloud and plans to bring it to Windows PCs and other devices this year. Apple released Apple Arcade in September 2019, and there's evidence that Amazon and Walmart are preparing to throw their hats in the ring. Google is also looking to beef up its live streaming of esports to compete with Amazon's Twitch Prime. This impetus was given legs at the beginning of 2020 when it announced that YouTube would host live broadcasts of Activision Blizzard's esports leagues and events, including the Call of Duty League. Overall, investment is rising in OTT. In its &quot;Where the Money Is Going: The Future of Sports Entertainment&quot; report, Deltatre pinpoints 2021 as a &quot;tipping point&quot; by which sports operators will spend more than $6.8 billion on OTT technology in North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report summary says, &quot;Investing in new functionality to maximise fan engagement through OTT services results in a 24% uplift in subscriber acquisition.&quot; In addition, senior sports executives say that the free&Acirc;&shy;mium model or family packages will become important for bringing new consumers in and then converting them to fully paid subscribers. Giampiero Rinaudo, CEO of Deltatre. Verizon prioritized 13 NFL stadiums, including Super Bowl LIV host Miami's Hard Rock Stadium, with 5G installation for spectator engagement in 2019 and plans to add 5G to all 32 stadiums. The cost for sports media rights in North America is expected to swell from $71 billion in 2018 to more than $83 billion in 2023, according to PwC. The major leagues still seem reluctant to ditch broadcast media for direct-to-consumer entirely. The MLB renewed its deal with FOX until 2028, and the NBA's deal with ESPN and TNT expires after the 2024-2025 season. The NFL's deals with FOX, CBS, and NBC expire after the 2022 season, and its deal with ESPN expires at the end of the 2021 season. With the next negotiations imminent, there will be discussion at the league about taking it all in-house with the NFL Game Pass. Peak TV has peaked. Well, that didn't take long. We now have more of a good thing than we ever wanted-and more is on the way. Just how long can this last?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center; clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/lLsynJl8JtA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen title=&quot;Trending Sport Trump Protest Shuts Down Interstate 94 in Minne&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China&acirc;Äôs most anticipated 2018 spring trail race began with techno jazzercising. It was 5 in the morning, and the starting line felt like a night club. Runners gathered behind a traditional Chinese gate-the same ones that adorn Chinatowns in American cities-doing jumping jacks and toe touches, syncing their stretches to thumping bass music. An instructor covered in spandex led the calisthenics, shouting through a headset. Smoke machines exploded in rhythm with the music, and floodlights lit up a banner hung from the gate: Gaoligong by UTMB. Near where I stood, a Chinese runner nodded in approval. EDM thumped for the next half hour, until Li Zhaohui, the event&acirc;Äôs emcee and broadcaster at the the Beijing Olympics&acirc;Äô track and field events, took the stage. That morning, he donned a vintage American Air Force flight jacket, embroidered with the emblem of The Flying Tigers, the U.S. Chinese in this region, just north of the Myanmar border in Yunnan Province, during World War II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strapped around his forehead were retro, 1940s flight goggles. The crowd cheered his entrance. &acirc;ÄúWe are here&acirc;Ä&brvbar;in Tengchong, the most beautiful city! &acirc;Äù he proclaimed, first in Chinese, then in heavily accented English. &acirc;ÄúYou can conquer the mountain&acirc;Ä&brvbar; Gaoligong! You can fly. You&acirc;Ä&brvbar;can touch the sky&acirc;Ä&brvbar; You are all heroes! It is&acirc;Ä&brvbar;amazing!&acirc;Äù The runners and crowd cheered, more than 200 strong. Next to me was Pavel Toropov of Xingzhi Exploring, the Chinese company organizing Gaoligong alongside UTMB, the top ultra race in the world, in France. The spectacle didn&acirc;Äôt faze him. He&acirc;Äôd been organizing races all over the world since 2011-a seven-year career of &acirc;Äúindustrial running&acirc;Äù as he called it-and Gaoligong was his latest project. Once, he told me, he&acirc;Äôd set a course in a Sri Lankan jungle while trying to avoid getting trampled by elephants. In Tengchong, he stood behind the gate calmly, expressionless, glancing occasionally at the foreign athletes he&acirc;Äôd invited to the race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background:rgba(0,0,0,0.1);padding:0px 10px 1px 10px;border-radius:5px;border:1px solid #000;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ispo.com/en/trends&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The latest trends in the sports industry - ISPO.com&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;cite&gt;www.ispo.com&lt;span class=&quot;eipWBe&quot;&gt; &acirc;Ä&ordm; trends&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;color:rgba(0,0,0,0.6);&quot;&gt;For the first time, H&amp;M is collaborating with an all-female surf community, to help empower and inspire togetherness amongst women all over the &lt;em&gt;world&lt;/em&gt;. Teaming&lt;wbr&gt; ...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The morning&acirc;Äôs 55K start marked the first of three races that weekend, with a 125K and 160K to follow. Ultrarunners Sunmaya Budha and Meredith Edwards were heavy foreign favorites in the women&acirc;Äôs 55K, Jason Schlarb and Nathan Montague in the men&acirc;Äôs. On stage, Li Zhaohui continued to rhapsodize, building to a crescendo before presenting the elite athletes, one by one, to blasts from smoke machines. Schlarb, Edwards, Budha, and Montague jogged onto the stage, and crowds of recreational runners pushed toward the guard rails, holding up their iPhones for pictures. The elite racers exploded out of the gate to surging music, and, behind them, crowds of recreational runners followed, with bright jackets and hydration packs, cheering and snapping pictures. Toropov called me over to a car, and I hopped into the backseat. Richard Bull, a race organizer in Nepal who had brought Nepalese runner Sunmaya Budha to the race, climbed in with me along with James Poole, a British runner and Hoka ambassador documenting the event for Strava.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we passed the runners on the road, heading into the mountains outside Tengchong, Poole looked up from his iPhone. &acirc;ÄúWell, that was quite something, wasn&acirc;Äôt it? &acirc;Äù he said. &acirc;ÄúReminded me of those improv theatre games: Give me a sporting event! Ultrarunning. Give me a place! China. Give me a mood! Toropov nodded, and we sped around mountain switchbacks to the first checkpoint. In the last five or so years, events like Gaoligong have embodied the glitzier side of a massive Chinese running boom. Most Chinese race organizers mark the surge as having begun around 2011 with a deluge of marathons, followed by a second wave of trail-running events in 2015. In those early years, many races were organized haphazardly, with frequent disasters. At some events, volunteers wouldn&acirc;Äôt show up because of bad weather, aid stations would be missing, and medevacs weren&acirc;Äôt available. Since then, Pavel told me, race quality has dramatically increased. That&acirc;Äôs partly because of experience, but also because of the movement's organic, grassroots oversight of races on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such activity creates a proximity between the sports stars and their fans and an opportunity for relevant brands to authentically sponsor the action. Sports teams are also able to leverage the social accounts of their top talent to boost engagement with their brand. Using the example of FC Barcelona, their Instagram following at 70 million is dwarfed by the 118m followers of its biggest star, Lionel Messi. Yet using their biggest footballing star in the role of authentic influencer, the club is able to promote the team as a whole, and the work they do. There has been a migration in the sports industry towards cause marketing, seeing big names and personalities using their authority to raise awareness of important issues. In 2018, former Manchester United star Rio Ferdinand and friend Jamie Moralee teamed up with mental health charity Calm (Campaign Against Living Miserably) to dispel harmful attitudes around men&acirc;Äôs mental health. Playing up to typical alpha male banter, the footballers answer questions like &acirc;Äúwho would win in a fight?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&acirc;Äù and &acirc;Äúwho can drink the most? &acirc;Äù before getting more personal about the importance of their friendship. By openly discussing their feelings and need for support, Ferdinand and Moralee were perfect ambassadors for the charity and helped to dismantle the traditional masculine stereotype. Moreover, Sport England&acirc;Äôs groundbreaking 2015 campaign, &acirc;ÄòThe Girl Can&acirc;Äô, was responsible for encouraging women to get more involved in sports. The minute-and-a-half spot features everyday women partaking in their fitness routines set to Missy Elliot&acirc;Äôs &acirc;ÄòGet Your Freak On&acirc;Äô. Rather than focusing on glamorous, impossibly fit women that create an intimidating culture in sport for the unfit among us, the ad homes in on the elements of exercise that are less than flattering - the sweat, the hard work - and celebrates them anyway. Similarly, it&acirc;Äôs important for brands to create narratives that both resonate with and involve their target audiences. A strong example of brand storytelling comes from Nike&acirc;Äôs &acirc;ÄòWe won it in France&acirc;Äô spot for the French national team, after they won the 2018 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launching the club&acirc;Äôs latest strip, Nike celebrated the hard work of the French team and its players by drawing on their impoverished backgrounds in the banlieues of Paris and arid pitches of Marseille. This ad was a love letter not only to the players but to the supporters and their country, interweaving their stories with that of the club. In recent years the popularity of eSports has seen exponential growth, a fact which has not been missed by sports teams. In particular, the format has proven popular with football teams with so many millions of their fanbase regularly playing Fifa videogames. Spanish football team Real Madrid recently released plans for their updated, high-tech new home stadium which will include an eSports arena for fans. This is not dissimilar to plans from Tottenham Hotspur to host eSports tournaments when its new stadium is completed. The club thinks it will be able to earn upwards of &Acirc;&pound;3m for every non-footballing event, due to its 60,000-seat capacity. This is not the first time that Spurs have shown the club&acirc;Äôs belief in the power of eSports. At the end of 2018, the club was one of 20 Premier League teams that launched a competition among their fans, offering winners the opportunity to compete for and represent their favorite team in the ePremier League, a competitive video gaming event. Christian Fuchs, a Premier League winner with Leicester City, is working on his own eSports venture called 'NoFuchsGiven'. &acirc;ÄúOne of my big goals right now and I'm in talks with several partners is that I will build an eSports arena in New York,&quot; Forbes quotes Fuchs as telling the SportsPro Live 2019 conference. &quot;I just purchased 36 acres, there are about 70 buildings on there.&lt;/p&gt;

The state, however, has seen a steady decline in coronavirus-related hospitalizations and deaths. The majority of the sports world ground to a halt in March amid the pandemic, however NHL, NBA and Major League Baseball are mulling their options for resuming their seasons. The NFL released its 2020 season schedule earlier this month with the hope of starting in September as usual. While Abbott cited May 31 as a target date, the Lone Star State is expected to serve as the host for The Genesys 600 NTT IndyCar Series race at Texas Motor Speedway on June 6 and the PGA Tour's Charles Schwab Challenge on June 11-14 at Colonial Country Club in Fort Worth. Both events will be held without fans in attendance.&lt;/p&gt;

In the past few years, we&acirc;Äôve seen a surge in urban run crews of all stripes-inclusive, competitive, causal, or hip and insidery-but the one I&acirc;Äôm most curious about is still on the cusp: the all-women run crew. Will we see it play out in U.S. There&acirc;Äôs arguably no time like now for the trend to happen: women continue to flood the running community, dominating road-racing numbers; we also know that women-supporting-women leads to positive running results (exhibit A: Shalane); and if 2017 gave us anything, it was a dose of female empowerment. Diverse, women-led groups and orgs are already thriving. The nationwide Black Girls Run! 200,000 members, and Voltwomen, &acirc;Äúa global community&acirc;Äù for female runners, is four years strong and growing. Since 2014, the number of finishers of U.S. Although 2017&acirc;Äôs figures won&acirc;Äôt be released until March, we suspect that trend will continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While bucket-list races continue to sell out-your Peachtree 10Ks, your New York City Marathons-we&acirc;Äôve noticed drops in finisher totals in many other big events throughout year. At the same time, all indications are that there have never been more Americans who run at least occasionally. Why the discrepancy? Runners are increasingly choosing informal, low-key outings over commercial, organized events. Think clubs and crews, social runs ending at pubs, solo trail jaunts, and the like. These DIY runs are less expensive, easier to fit into busy schedules, and customized to meet individual runners&acirc;Äô desires. The rise of running crews is terrific news for a variety of reasons. Crews welcome in an entirely fresh contingent to running, and they strip away the pretension inherent in more conventional running clubs. That&acirc;Äôs awesome. But selfishly, I love that they also ignore the deep-seated conventions of how to dress for a run. I wore short shorts for most of high school and college-but now, less serious, often injured, in my mid-twenties, and primarily logging erratic mileage throughout New York City, I am just so tired of being heckled by teens for my bare and vulnerable thighs. These days, though, I mostly run in knee-length shorts, and when teens are around, I&acirc;Äôm golden. I think we&acirc;Äôll see a new marathon world record-by just a few seconds-and then hundreds of stories talking about when the 2-hour barrier will be broken. Spoiler: Not anytime soon! The record run will happen in Berlin (like the last six), and the runner will likely be wearing Nike&acirc;Äôs Vaporfly 4% or something similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, their running style is videotaped and played back to them. Its a 360-degree approach that few other cities can match, said DHemecourt, whos also co-medical director of the Boston Marathon. DHemecourt pinpoints four major components of a runners gait that could lead to injury. First, theres the heel strike. Then theres overstriding, or extending your foot beyond your hip. Women in the military, for example, reported a high rate of femoral neck stress fractures. As it turned out, they were lengthening their natural stride to keep up with men in daily marches. Third is a slow cadence, an inefficient running pattern. A faster cadence minimizes the likelihood of overstriding, since the quicker steps push for a shorter stride. Fourth, many runners lean forward. &Acirc;ìYou should be landing with your hips, knees, and ankles bent a little bit so that you land under your center of gravity,&Acirc;î he said. Overall, the goal is to go easy on our bodies when we run, DHemecourt said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He recommends using a treadmill to &Acirc;ìget a feel for that nice soft landing. Researchers arent the only running enthusiasts whove found a home at Harvard. In the past several years, the Universitys community of noncompetitive runners has grown by leaps and bounds. Running is the perfect activity to bring faculty, students, and staff together, said Craig Rodgers, a counselor at the Bureau of Study Counsel, who started the Harvard College Marathon Challenge (HCMC) in 2005. More than 470 people from around the University have joined the groups email listserv. Members use it to post information about races and events, to share tips, and to find last-minute running buddies. &Acirc;ìYou dont need anything other than a pair of shoes, or not even a pair of shoes, if you want to go barefoot with us,&Acirc;î Rodgers said. &Acirc;ìIts something people can do easily on short notice. Harvard On The Move, a year-old University-wide initiative to promote physical activity, can attract as many as 40 or 50 people to its biweekly runs.&lt;/p&gt;

North America chief executive Stefan Kozak and North America president and chief marketing officer Amy Taylor were let go, the energy drink company said Tuesday. While Red Bull employees in the US have been pressing for the company to be more vocal about racism, Red Bull's billionaire CEO Dietrich Mateschitz is a Donald Trump admirer who has spoken out against 'political correctness'. The 76-year-old tycoon also owns a media firm which has been criticized for giving a platform to far-right activists in his native Austria. Sources told Business Insider that Red Bull's top executives in Austria are thought to have fired Kozak and Taylor in 'retaliation' for the leak, although no official reason was given for their departure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter signed by more than 300 employees had criticized the company for 'saying nothing' amid the global anti-racism protests and 'abandoning the communities we claim to support and foster in their time of greatest need'. Both Kozak and Taylor have pushed for more diversity and inclusion but Taylor was 'met with opposition' when she called for the company to take a more public stand on racism, The Wall Street Journal reports. A third executive, head of global culture marketing Florian Klaass, has also left after he allegedly approved a racist slide shown in a meeting earlier this year. The leaked slide, shown at a meeting in Detroit, is said to have shown racist stereotypes from countries around the world. Labels on the map allegedly said 'they do our laundry' on Mexico, 'they make our stuff' on China, 'evil-doers' on the Middle East with an arrow indicating 'bombs go here', and 'zoo animals come from here' on Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Fashion Trends In High End Jewelry]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='https://media2.cgtrader.com/variants/1Kb6xG91EsvLUW3Zx88BaMva/9cae6891d5963582c5a024dd4cd2d77f44d540a2ca4f778b8c6afa6918049521/hard-chair-3d-model-max-obj-3ds-fbx.jpg' style=&quot;clear:both; float:right; padding:10px 0px 10px 10px; border:0px; max-width: 375px;&quot;&gt;Within the jewelry world there are classic pieces that seem to always be in style, however there are also those very unique trends that come around every now and then to really shake things up. High end jewelry or fine jewelry lines are not immune to the impact of trends. Often just having the trend shown within a high end line means that it is moved beyond the trend stage and is now an acceptable fashion accessory or style. Although gold has been around for centuries, the allure of this precious metal keeps it on top of the latest in fashion trends for all season wear. One of the newer fashion styles to &lt;a Href=&quot;https://www.sportaus.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/665857/34871_Connecting_Digital_with_Sport_Final_V3.pdf&quot;&gt;sport&lt;/a&gt; gold is the multi-layered necklace. This style is typically in three layers of chain, attaching to the top layer with a single clasp at the back. The three layers or chains, shortest to longest, are separated enough to allow charms, beads or smaller gold pieces to hang between the layers, creating a warm, soft appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;clear:both; float:right; padding:10px 0px 10px 10px; border:0px; max-width: 375px;&quot; src=&quot;https://storage.cgtrader.com/rails/active_storage/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBLy9uaWc9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--93c15f4db0d875375fdc30850e8eba695bab6242/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdCam9VWTI5dFltbHVaVjl2Y0hScGIyNXpld282QzNKbGMybDZaVWtpRFRZM05uZzFNREErQmpvR1JVWTZER2R5WVhacGRIazZDMk5sYm5SbGNqb01kVzV6YUdGeWNFa2lFakl1Tkhnd0xqUXJNUzQzS3pBR093ZFVPZzVwYm5SbGNteGhZMlZKSWdwUWJHRnVaUVk3QjFRNkRIRjFZV3hwZEhscFdnPT0iLCJleHAiOm51bGwsInB1ciI6InZhcmlhdGlvbiJ9fQ==--623c6a310f0f834f948241cae8d918ff137f5aa9/W02.jpg&quot; class=&quot;wp-post-image&quot;&gt;These stacked type necklaces are ideally suited to various open necklines but can also be worn as an accent to a jacket or over a top with a straight or high neckline. Since they are not long, hanging necklaces they are easy to wear and add a touch of richness. Another gold high end fashion jewelry trend is the return to the bangle bracelets. These aren't the old, clunky style of bracelets from the 60's, rather they are exquisitely crafted with gold wire accents, designs and even gemstones. The bracelets can be worn as singles or can be stacked on the wrist to add color and depth to the gold tones. When stacked these gold bracelets are typically mixed, with wider and narrower bangles, solid and decorated and even different types of metals. Trends in the designer rings currently seen in fashion shows and through designer collections continue to include the large, chunky rings that really make a statement. While the majority feature gold, there are also many in platinum, white gold and silver, with natural and synthesized gems. Unlike many of the older styles of rings there is typically one gemstone, not a collection or grouping. These rings are really the latest in fashion trends in the high end lines, with enamel, cut crystal and large semi-precious gems the most popular accent in the ring. One of the biggest fashion trends in the more expensive jewelry lines is away from the chandelier type earrings towards more sleek and minimal type designs. These can include larger hoop type earrings or even longer, thinner styles of earrings that are also of various lengths to compliment any hairstyle and face shape. Earrings may be all precious metal or may have small, discrete gemstones to add color and dazzle. Emphasis is on the movement of the earrings, not just on the glitz and glamour. Smaller stud type diamond earrings are more evident in the high end fashion lines, some with colored diamonds to add that individual look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fans of bobble heads have the sport world to thank for the insurgence of interest in this fun and memorable collectible item. After being around for over a hundred years, first made of papier mache and later from porcelain, but not being very popular, major league baseball produced a series of these dolls for each baseball team in the 1960's, and started a trend that went on for many years. Those custom made figurines had all the same angel like face. Player specific dolls for Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays, Roger Maris and Roberto Clemente were produced and sold for the first time during the 1960 World Series and became a collector's item. Although the uniforms were different, each of them shared the same face. In the 1970's they become popular in other sports as well, as well as cartoon characters that were famous at the time. When the first Beatles custom dolls became a huge hit, and are still a rare and valuable item these days, other businesses started looking into bobble heads as a way of fun advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mid 1970's these dolls had fallen out of favor and very few of them were produced until the 1990's when new manufacturing processes allowed these dolls to be made of plastic, reducing the expense and difficulty of creating quality bobble heads for a fraction of the cost. By 1999 the San Francisco Giants baseball team gave out 35,000 free Willie Mays figurines to their fans and again, the dolls become a huge favorite of sports fans and collectors. There was such a huge demand that many lesser known players and cultural and notable figures got a doll of their own. Today, these figurines come in many shapes and forms. There are mini bobble heads, bobble computer sitters, bobble head banks and even bobble head air fresheners. Customized dolls became a possibility, and some companies offer making a doll that resembles the player so closely that they include the tattoos and even the scars of the famous players.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Hyundai's New SUV Turns On The Charm]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;It's fair to say the nice people at Hyundai are keen on their place names. You only have to look at their SUV range to work that out. They've got the Santa Fe, which as we all know is a city in the US state of New Mexico. There's the Kona, named, no doubt after Hawaii's &quot;big island&quot; of the same name. And, of course, the Tucson, sharing its moniker with the city in Arizona. Hyundai's corporate cousins, Kia, have also joined the trend with their popular SUV, the Sorrento (which is not just a coastal town in southwest Italy but also a beach retreat south of Melbourne). But it seems the Hyundai naming department either ran out of time, or ran out of inspiration, before putting the badges on their new baby SUV. It's called the Venue. Better than calling it the Place, I guess. Or the Spot. Or Location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.pinimg.com/originals/02/4d/43/024d43b1e8ec237638d59d48c1dc0946.png&quot; alt=&quot;Liverpool beat Spurs and Southampton - Premier League ...&quot; class=&quot;wp-post-image&quot; style=&quot;clear:both; float:left; padding:10px 10px 10px 0px;border:0px; max-width: 395px;&quot;&gt;But a somewhat unflattering sobriquet for what is actually a fairly charming little machine. The pint-sized Venue (makes it sound like an intimate cocktail bar) is the newest Hyundai model and it virtually completes the dance card for the ambitious Korean marque's SUV fleet. Well, at least for the moment, or until they find some other place names they like the sound of. It sits right at the bottom of the ever-expanding Hyundai SUV range and with a price ranging upwards from $19,990 plus on road costs, is one of the most affordable SUVs on the market. It's aimed at creating a new entry-point in the Hyundai range for young couples or families looking for a snappy little city runabout. And in that sense it fits the bill very effectively. The Venue range offers three variants, all bringing the same 1.6-litre engine and choice of six-speed manual or automatic transmissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tested the top-spec Elite model ($25,490), bringing with it a surprisingly generous array of technical features as well as a funky two-tone paint job (blue body, white roof) and a fairly distinctive personality. As well as anchoring the SUV range, it figures to replace the ageing Accent hatchback as Hyundai's most affordable model - yet another demonstration that SUVs are taking over the world. All well and good, but there's also a bit of a risk for Hyundai in cars like the Venue, and it is this: Having worked so hard to escape from their &quot;cheap and cheerful&quot; reputation - through building truly high-quality machines like the i30 and its excellent SUVs - budget-focused cars like this one tend not to deliver quite the same levels of finish and style. The truth is that small, inexpensive models can tend to drag the brand down to their level - unless they are absolutely excellent. Mazda's 2, for instance, actually helps elevate the Japanese brand by being so good, for such a low price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against that background, our first impressions of the Venue were of a car that just felt a little bit lacking in the quality we've come to expect from Hyundai in recent years. It's got a revvy, slightly harsh four-cylinder engine, mated to a six-speed automatic transmission that tends to hunt around a bit for the correct gear, and generally lacks refinement. The car's interior, while delivering a funky, modern look, also tends to feel a bit cheap. The hard plastics, the strange integration of the infotainment system, the slightly dull instrument panel. And while the Elite model looked quite cool with its square-ish design and larger 17-inch alloy wheels, its two lower-spec variants look rather awkward with their tiny 15-inch rims. In fairness, our opinion of the little Hyundai grew steadily fonder the longer we drove it. In particular, the extensive electronic safety suite impressed for a car in this segment - with all models offering lane keeping assist, pedestrian detection, high beam assist, tyre pressure monitoring, not to mention touch-screen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay as standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mid-range Active adds parking sensors and cornering lights, while the flagship Elite also boasts satellite navigation with live traffic updates, blind-spot monitoring and cross-traffic alert. Despite our slight misgivings about the drive train, the Venue is a sturdy little machine that feels perfectly adequate at highway speeds - impressively so for such a small thing. It's no firecracker (with 90kw and 151Nm it could hardly be expected to be) but in sport mode can be quite fun to drive. On balance, though, despite the generous equipment I could not see myself forking out the almost $30-grand needed to buy this Elite model in preference to, say, a mid-spec i30 or even a fairly basic VW Golf. Of course that's why different cars appeal to different drivers and I'm hardly typical of the target market for the Venue. Those buyers are most likely to be young and female, I suspect, although small families would also find some appeal. In that regard, the Venue is sure to find its own place in the small car market. HOW BIG? It's a sub-compact SUV which makes it pint-sized - but its square-style design means it is surprisingly roomy inside, despite its small dimensions. HOW FAST? Not at all - but it's still quite fun to drive. HOW THIRSTY? Not particularly impressive for a small machine - 7.2L/100km for the automatic version; slightly less for the manual. HOW MUCH? The starting price beneath $20 grand, with decent spec and the appeal of an SUV, makes it worth a look for young buyers. The Elite also represents solid value at $25,490 plus on-road costs.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The CR-V claims the title with a long list of vehicle enhancements for 2015, including its improved fuel economy and uncompromised driving dynamics, thanks to the inclusion of Honda's Earth Dreams Technology powertrain, the launch of an all-new Touring trim, the debut of Honda Sensing safety and driver assistive technologies and the CR-V's excellent value for money paradigm. Motor Trend's Sport/Utility of the Year is not a comparison test, and is only open to all-new or substantially upgraded vehicles that have gone on sale in the 12 months from November 1 of the previous year. To judge contenders for the award, Motor Trend's editorial staff conducted an exhaustive three-phase testing process. Phase one includes a full tech check and weigh-in, then full track testing to establish baseline data for acceleration, braking and handling. Phase two involves three days of road loops offering a range of road surfaces and traffic conditions to evaluate ride and handling, engine and transmission smoothness and responsiveness, wind and road noise and ergonomics. An off-road section tests traction, stability, and braking control systems. In the third phase the judges debate and deliberate.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Blockchain A Home-Run In The Sports World - Use Cases Climbing In 2020]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The new decade has kicked off with blockchain technology finally being utilized in real case scenarios in the world of sports. Many blockchain proponents are enthusiastic about the wide variety of potential use cases, but real-life working examples are often hard to come by. The potential of the technology to underpin a variety of systems within the sports sector has long been discussed, but just two months into the new year, there have already been several prominent use cases where blockchain technology is being used to improve offerings to fans. From the football-mad continent of Europe to the world of the NFL and Major League Baseball, blockchain-based applications are being used to improve ticketing, merchandising and interactions between audiences and sports teams and organizations. Every four years, the best international football teams in Europe battle it out in the UEFA European Championship, more commonly known as the Euros to football fans. The 16th edition of the tournament will be hosted by 12 cities across the continent between June and July. The best 24 teams that progress through the qualifiers will battle it out to be crowned the kings of European football.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/cvk18vx-nrY?rel=0&amp;playsinline=1&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen title=&quot;trend sport world&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ticketing is one of the most challenging aspects for the tournament&acirc;Äôs organizers, with over 28 million ticket requests for the 2020 showpiece across 200 countries. For the first time ever, UEFA has turned to a blockchain-powered mobile app to provide a contemporary ticketing solution for fans. UEFA aims to supply and deliver 1 million tickets through the Euro 2020 app. There are some benefits to the app-based ticketing system. Firstly, it will rule out the possibility of replicating tickets. Fans won&acirc;Äôt need to visit ticketing offices either, they&acirc;Äôll simply have to turn on WiFi on their smartphones when they arrive at the stadium, which will then activate their ticket QR codes and allow entry. The move also eliminates paper waste. The primary benefit of an app-based ticketing system is the ease of distribution across the sheer number of countries. Ultimately, UEFA&acirc;Äôs move to use blockchain technology to power its ticketing operation is a major boon for the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background:rgba(0,0,0,0.1);padding:0px 10px 1px 10px;border-radius:5px;border:1px solid #000;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://visua.com/sports-sponsorship-trends/&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sports Sponsorship Trends for 2019 - visua-logo&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;cite&gt;visua.com&lt;span class=&quot;eipWBe&quot;&gt; &acirc;Ä&ordm; sports-sponsorshi...&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;color:rgba(0,0,0,0.6);&quot;&gt;The &lt;em&gt;world&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Sports&lt;/em&gt; Sponsorship has seen much growth in the last couple of years. So what &lt;em&gt;trends&lt;/em&gt; should we expect to see in 2019? Esports sponsorship has&lt;wbr&gt; ...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that football is the most popular sport in the world, the adoption of the technology could set a trend for other service providers to follow. Blockchain-powered fan engagement platform Socios seems to be setting the tone for adoption in the sporting world. As previously reported, the Socios platform allows sports organizations and teams to launch their own tokens that can be used for a variety of activities on the platform. Users can participate in votes for club decisions as well as use tokens to access content and memorabilia. The platform has collaborated with a number of the world&acirc;Äôs biggest football clubs over the last few years - such as Barcelona, Juventus, Paris-Saint Germain, Galatasaray, Atletico Madrid and A.S. Socios welcomed Barcelona to its platform in February 2020, just a week before announcing its move into the American sports &lt;a Href = 'https://www.statista.com/outlook/259/100/sports-outdoor/worldwide' &gt;market&lt;/a&gt;. Chiliz, the fintech platform that created Socios, has also teamed up with marketing agency Lagardere Sports and Entertainment. The agency has a major foothold in the United States, and Chiliz is hoping to onboard a number of new teams and organizations to the Socios platforms through Lagardere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teams involved in the NFL and Major League Baseball are obvious targets. A number of football teams have also been licensed in the digital collectibles space in a partnership with blockchain platform Sorare, which was announced in February 2020. The platform offers fans blockchain-based player trading cards that are used to play a five-card fantasy football game. The player cards earn points in relation to their actual player&acirc;Äôs performance in real-life games. Cards are tiered, with the rarest cards guaranteed digital scarcity through blockchain technology. Cards can also be transferred to the Ethereum blockchain. According to the platform&acirc;Äôs website, over 38 clubs have been officially licensed. A couple of NBA teams have welcomed the cryptocurrency sector by accepting payments in Bitcoin (BTC) over the past few years. The Sacramento Kings and the Dallas Mavericks have allowed fans to purchase tickets and merchandise using Bitcoin. The Sacramento Kings are likely the most innovative blockchain adopters in the sporting world. The organization claims to be one of the world&acirc;Äôs most technologically advanced sporting brands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Golden 1 Center stadium&acirc;Äôs roof is covered in solar panels, boasts ridiculously fast WiFi for fans, and has a cryptocurrency mining operation running in its data center - the proceedings from which are donated to local charities. If that is not impressive enough, the Kings also offer fans exclusive memorabilia and other items on a couple of blockchain-based platforms. In 2019, they launched crypto-collectibles powered by the Ethereum-based platform CryptoKaiju. Following that, the Kings unveiled a new offering in January 2020 in collaboration with Consensys that allows fans to bid for in-game sports gear worn by Kings players during live games through a mobile-based app. There&acirc;Äôs a massive market for authentic, in-game items, but the authenticity of auctioned items has always been a pitfall. The app provides a solution to this problem by opening an auction marketplace that provides authentic game-worn items in real-time. The club will sell tickets to both local and international matches at Old Trafford cricket ground after testing out the platform in 2019. As more supporters have started to buy tickets online, the club is using the blockchain-based platform to combat ticket fraud and improve data on ticket distribution. The technology also makes it far easier for people to resell or transfer tickets to other supporters. Lancashire&acirc;Äôs move is thought to be a first in the world of cricket and can be counted as another sports organization beginning to harness the advantages of blockchain-powered technology. It is encouraging to see a number of organizations actively using blockchain technology to improve their offerings to sports fans. Whether it&acirc;Äôs having access to exclusive content and memorabilia or knowing that the purchased tickets are authentically validated, sport enthusiasts are slowly being introduced to blockchain-based solutions even if they are not aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Globally, 1.4 Billion Adults At Risk Of Disease From Not Doing Enough Physical Activity]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Together, these estimates demonstrate that there has been little progress in improving physical activity levels between 2001 and 2016. The data show that if current trends continue, the 2025 global activity target of a 10% relative reduction in insufficient physical activity will not be met. Dr. Regina Guthold of the WHO, Switzerland. In 2016, around one in three women (32%) and one in four men (23%) worldwide were not reaching the recommended levels of physical activity to stay healthy-ie, at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity per week. The new study is based on self-reported activity levels, including activity at work and at home, for transport, and during leisure &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jd.id/product/casio-baby-g-world-time-ba-120kt-7ajr-sport-trend-women-s-watch-46mm_51879296/504221986.html&quot;&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;, in adults aged 18 years and older from 358 population-based surveys in 168 countries, including 1.9 million participants. In 2016, levels of insufficient activity among adults varied widely across income groups-16% in low-income countries compared to 37% in high-income countries. In 55 (33%) of 168 countries, more than a third of the population was insufficiently physically active. Countries with the lowest levels of insufficient physical activity in 2016 were Uganda and Mozambique (6% each).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;clear:both; float:right; padding:10px 0px 10px 10px; border:0px; max-width: 370px;&quot; src=&quot;https://burst.shopifycdn.com/photos/camping-on-top-of-the-world.jpg?width=746&amp;format=pjpg&amp;exif=0&amp;iptc=0&quot; alt=&quot;Camping On Top Of The World&quot; class='wp-post-image'&gt;Women were less active than men in all regions of the world, apart from east and southeast Asia. Across regions, many individual countries recorded large differences in insufficient activity between women and men. From 2001-2016, substantial changes in insufficient physical activity levels were recorded in multiple regions. The regions with the highest increase in insufficient activity over time were high-income Western countries (from 31% in 2001 to 37% in 2016), and Latin America and the Caribbean (33% to 39%). Countries from these regions driving this trend include Germany, New Zealand, the USA, Argentina, and Brazil. The region with the largest decrease in insufficient activity was east and southeast Asia (from 26% in 2001 to 17% in 2016), which was largely influenced by uptake of physical activity in China, the most populated country in the region. In wealthier countries, the transition towards more sedentary occupations, recreation and motorised transport could explain the higher levels of inactivity, while in lower-income countries, more activity is undertaken at work and for transport, according to the authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While declines in occupational and domestic physical activity are inevitable as countries prosper, and use of technology increases, governments must provide and maintain infrastructure that promotes increased walking and cycling for transport and active sports and recreation. The action plan, titled More active people for a healthier world, launched in June 2018, recommends a set of 20 policy areas, which, combined, aim to create more active societies through improving the spaces and places for physical activity as well as increasing programs and opportunities for people of all ages and abilities to do more walking, cycling, sport, active recreation, dance and play. The plan is a road map for the actions needed by all countries to reduce insufficient physical activity in adults and adolescents. The study's release comes ahead of the Third United Nations General Assembly High-level Meeting on NCDs and their risk factors, including physical inactivity, being held on 27 September 2018 in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jon Anik, Joe Rogan and Daniel Cormier, there aren't many better commentary teams in the sport, and all three were in place, albeit at a social distance, to call the action. And it was former heavyweight and light heavyweight champion Cormier who found himself affecting the action more than he had anticipated. At 41 years of age, and having achieved seemingly all there is to achieve in the sport, there are few in a better position than Cormier to read and analyse top level fights. At cageside and with no fans to generate a din, Cormier's analysis of the fights was audible from inside the octagon, and fighters were able to pick up on his comments and adjust their fights accordingly. For heavyweight Greg Hardy and strawweight Carla Esparza, it took Cormier's instructions on commentary, rather than the calls of those in their corner, to evoke the necessary response and change the course of the fight, with both emerging with wins on Saturday. Thank God for not having the crowd,' Hardy told Rogan in his post-fight interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shout out to DC (Daniel Cormier). I heard him tell me to check him (Yorgan De Castro's leg kicks), that I needed to figure out how to check it. So I started trying to check him. Esparza benefitted from Cormier's analysis that she was struggling to find a rhythm against the tricky Michelle Waterson, and that mixing up her wrestling and striking would help her overcome that hurdle. It's crazy because he was kind of criticising me! Cormier admitted after the event that his expert insight may prove to be an issue at upcoming events. We've got to do something about that,' he said. If we're going to do it like this, we've got to find a way to not coach these guys. Away from the action, all eyes were on the UFC to implement the infrastructure necessary to ensure that the sport could continue safely during the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;img style='max-width: 380px;' alt='Basball Field At Night' src='https://burst.shopifycdn.com/photos/basball-field-at-night.jpg?width=746&amp;format=pjpg&amp;exif=0&amp;iptc=0'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The largest concussion study ever conducted in professional hockey was published today in the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ). It found several clinical signs and symptoms that predicted players being off the ice for more time. Headache, low energy or fatigue, memory loss, and abnormal neurological exam were significant predictors of time loss for players with concussions. Dr. Brian Benson, a researcher and physician at The Sport Medicine Centre in the University of Calgary's Faculty of Kinesiology. The NHL and NHLPA have historically paved the way in professional sports for establishing comprehensive concussion surveillance and management programs. They have been prospectively and systematically collecting data since 1997 with members of the NHL/NHLPA Concussion Working Group analyzing and discussing the data on a regular basis. The Working Group consists of physicians, neuropsychologists, former NHL players, and representatives from the league and NHL Players' Association. Concussions are caused by traumatic force. While concussion symptoms resolve over time once injuries are identified and appropriately managed, they can be career-ending. In the United States it is estimated that roughly 1.6 to 3.8 million sports and recreation-related brain injuries take place each year.&lt;/p&gt;

Arctic sea ice is experiencing a continuing decline that may not&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The study looked at 559 concussions suffered by NHL players in regular season games between 1997 and 2004 and was based on physicians' reports from every team in the league. The estimated incidence was 1.8 concussions per 1,000 player-hours. Typical time loss in days increased 2.25 times during the study period for every recurrent concussion. The report was written by Benson along with University of Calgary colleagues Dr. Willem Meeuwisse and Dr. Jian Kang. Dr. John Rizos from the University of Toronto and Dr. Charles Burke from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Centre were also involved. Benson and Meeuwisse are also planning to launch a world class Concussion Clinic and Clinical Research Program at The Sport Medicine Centre in the University of Calgary's Faculty of Kinesiology in the near future. The research program will serve to develop novel strategies for the assessment, management, and prevention of concussion. It will consist of a collaborative interdisciplinary team that brings together experts in Sport Medicine, Rehabilitation, Neurology, Neurosciences and Robotics. The ultimate goal of this initiative is to improve the health, social and economic outcomes for Albertans through clinical research excellence that makes a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That line of thinking suggests that records will plateau over time, but that hinges on the idea that the sport is widely played and accessible to those who may one day become elites as Nate Silver points out in analysis of record-breaking at the Beijing and London Olympics. In sports like track, odds are that someone with the right combination of skill and biology to break that record has already taken up the game and trained in the right way to do so. For instance, 2008 paper on 13 track and field sports suggested that there was still room for improvement in sports men's shotput, javelin and &quot;especially&quot; the women's marathon. That same paper we are nearing the ceiling for sports like the men's marathon, and the 800 and 1500 meter for women. It's possible we've entered the plateau phase of competitive hot dog eating, at least for the reigning champions. In 2020, Chestnut was only able to top his 2020 record of 74 hot dogs in 10 minutes by one hot dog, after all. There are likely many more dramatic record-shattering moments in competitive hot dog eating ahead of us. NOT SPORTS is an occasional series from Inverse.

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[But A Growing Number Of Researchers]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;But until recently, Garber described himself as &Acirc;ìrecidivist runner.&Acirc;î The cause wasnt a lack of enthusiasm or even of precious time, but an all-too-common phenomenon for regular runners: repeat injury. &Acirc;ìI was at the point where injuries were making it questionable whether Id be able to continue to run,&Acirc;î he said. Most people know about runners high. But for most runners, injury is as much a part of the experience as euphoria. Studies vary widely, but it is estimated that between 30 and 80 percent of regular runners are injured in a given year. Shin splints, runners knee, iliotibial band syndrome, plantar fasciitis: For many years, everyone from coaches to biologists to casual joggers has accepted such injuries almost as a necessary evil. But a growing number of researchers, many of them at Harvard, are convinced it doesnt have to be that way. Whats more, they say, we often dont need equipment to solve our many aches and pains. The human body, they argue, is built to run.&lt;/p&gt;

In a fast evolving &lt;em&gt;world&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;sport&lt;/em&gt; is increasingly subjected ... While the &lt;em&gt;trend&lt;/em&gt; of new sporting formats and leagues.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a growing body of scientific research, theyre figuring out exactly how humans were meant to move. These medical clinicians, biologists, and anthropologists are part of a cohort at Harvard, including several University-affiliated research centers, that may be unique in combining breadth and depth of research on the subject at a single university. &Acirc;ìTheres an amazing group of people at Harvard working on helping people run better,&Acirc;î said Daniel Lieberman, professor and chair of human evolutionary biology and principal investigator in the departments Skeletal Bio Lab. Lieberman is at least partly responsible for that. As an advocate of barefoot running and co-author of several groundbreaking papers in the journal Nature, he has kept running in the scientific spotlight for the past several years. The first paper, written in 2004 with longtime collaborator Dennis Bramble at the University of Utah, marshaled the fossil records evidence for why we run. The paper was only the second published study on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first came out in 1984. Running had simply been overlooked by most evolutionary biologists, who instead focused on why we developed the biomechanical tools for walking, our primary means of locomotion. &Acirc;ìWe think of walking as the quintessential human gait, and it is,&Acirc;î Lieberman said. But as he and Bramble pointed out, &Acirc;ìthe human body is also loaded with features that make us really exceptional runners. For instance, humans have a number of adaptations that help stabilize the head during running. As an example, Lieberman points out the nuchal ligament, a rubber band-like structure that emerges from a tiny raised ridge on the back of the human skull, that isnt present in our closest relatives, chimpanzees and gorillas. A series of &Acirc;ìsprings&Acirc;î &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.roundhillinvestments.com/research/esports/esports-viewership-vs-sports&quot;&gt;in&lt;/a&gt; our legs and feet, including our long Achilles tendons and the plantar arch along the underside of the foot, helps us to store and release energy efficiently when running. Our gluteus maximus muscle &Acirc;ó more commonly known for giving the round shape to our rear ends &Acirc;ó is distinctively enlarged in humans, helping to stabilize our trunks when running and keeping us from pitching forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lieberman and Bramble hypothesized that many of these traits evolved 2 million years ago, when running would have been advantageous to early hunters who lacked sophisticated tools. An aptitude for endurance running would have allowed hunters to chase down and weaken their prey, driving them into hyperthermia. Humans would be less likely to overheat during long runs thanks to their larger number of sweat glands and relative lack of body hair. The article touched a nerve. Lieberman received hundreds of emails, and the study was mentioned in nearly 1,000 news reports. &Acirc;ìI think people want to understand why they like running and why even average humans are so good at it, and why some people are so unbelievably good at it,&Acirc;î Lieberman said. &Acirc;ìTheres a reason people love a marathon: They actually enjoy it. Its not a nasty chore. As more researchers embrace the idea of running as a natural human activity, theres been a shift away from developing bigger and better orthotics toward instilling better biomechanics.&lt;/p&gt;

Davis, a visiting professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Harvard Medical School (HMS), came to Harvard a little over a year ago from the University of Delaware to start the SNRC, which will hold its grand opening for the public on April 12. The center combines a running injury clinic with a research laboratory, where Davis hopes to develop even better interventions to prevent musculoskeletal injuries in runners. &Acirc;ìI wanted to take my research to the next level,&Acirc;î she said.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style='clear:both; float:right; padding:10px 0px 10px 10px; border:0px; max-width: 375px;' src='https://media2.cgtrader.com/variants/LmrZmspy4e8WaviQFHywKknH/9cae6891d5963582c5a024dd4cd2d77f44d540a2ca4f778b8c6afa6918049521/pink-panther-3d-model-low-poly-rigged-ma-mb.jpg' class='wp-post-image'&gt;For more than a decade, the business industry has seen a great amount of growth and development all around the world. A lot of changes have taken place in the business industry and some of the changes have been truly path breaking. One such development is in the field of outsourcing. Business process outsourcing companies have mushroomed around the world in the last couple of years and the trend of outsourcing business processes has become a common practice in a lot of business ventures. However, the usefulness and the need of the companies that help in outsourcing businesses have been a reason for debates and arguments ever since they have existed. While there may be a class of people who staunchly believe in outsourcing, there may be those who may be completely opposed to the idea but in trying to understand whether the process has been beneficial to the mother companies, the outsourced and companies and the people in general, it is essential to check the advantages and the disadvantages of the service to know whether it is a boon or a bane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the trend of outsourcing was ripe and in its absolute peak, a lot of hue and cry was made over how the jobs of locals were going to other countries because of the outsourced companies being in other companies, this played a spoil sport in the development of the industry and stunted its growth to a great extent. It was also said that the culture and the ethics of work were compromised because of the outrageous salary packages and the perks that the western companies offered to the staff of their outsourced companies, this took a toll on the hiring processes and the businesses of the local companies. It was also said that the BPO culture played a big part in playing with the careers of the local youth who joined the industry to be able to earn a quick buck. On the other hand, it was considered that the productivity of the mother companies increased manifold as the functions such as customer service were outsourced and the business were able to concentrate better on the productivity. It is also considered that the business process outsourcing companies contributed greatly to the economy of the country and the lifestyles of the people who may not have earned very highly in normal circumstances. The western work ethics were introduced to local markets, which made it easier for the local companies to copy the model and make unique success stories. The trend of outsourcing business also played a great role in the creation of extra-ordinary infrastructure and offices in order to reflect the grandeur and the status of the western countries that gave business to the local outsourcing partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think are the major reasons for the lack of professional tennis players in the UK? Wow - big question! For me, there are three main reasons. Firstly, it's still too expensive to play tennis in the UK. I appreciate that there have been, and are, many schemes in different places to change this, but we in Britain need to recognise that tennis is a year-round sport - not just a summer sport. That means providing indoor courts. There aren't enough of them, and then those that there are, generally charge too much for the Average Joe to play on. Make it cheap. If there are unbooked courts, open them up for free, or for discounted prices. Secondly, there is a huge challenge in keeping youngsters playing tennis, as opposed to other sports. British teenagers are often given a large range of sports to play, and a large percentage of the talented ones are good at more than one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to try and ensure greater numbers of kids stick with tennis, rather than drift off to football, rugby, cricket etc. Thirdly, I believe that the British tennis &quot;system&quot; is too easy for those that are cherry-picked for special attention. The LTA's National Tennis Centre in Roehampton is a brilliant facility, but I can't help but feel that the youngsters using it don't know they're born. Everything is laid on for them - food, accommodation, massaging, physiotherapy, every element of sports science and medicine that you can think of. The cynic in me feels that breeds a soft competitor. If you look at the champions of the past, very often you find players who have had to battle adversity or make huge sacrifices to pursue their dream. If you've had everything laid on a plate for you from the start, where's the hunger to go and tough it out in a Challenger event in Uzbekistan in November?&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Upward Trend In Powersports]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/dzVIZBwoi-c?showinfo=0&amp;fs=0&amp;cc_load_policy=1&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen title=&quot;2010 Volkswagen CC&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the many categories that comprise the aftermarket, powersports stands out with consumers for its ability to offer fun, utility and outdoor recreation. According to research by Global Market Insights, the industry is expected to trend upward from $11 billion in 2018 to $14.5 billion by 2025. Interestingly, much of the current growth is attributable not to motorcycles, the category&acirc;Äôs traditional stalwarts, but to the rise of utility-task vehicles (UTVs), also commonly called side-by-sides. &acirc;ÄúWhile motorcycles represent the most mature segment of the powersports market, sales of new two-wheelers have tumbled during the past decade,&acirc;Äù said Greg Boeder, senior partner of Power Products Marketing (PPM), a powersports market research and analysis firm. Boeder cited statistics from the Motorcycle Industry Council indicating that there were approximately 457,000 new motorcycles and scooters sold in the United States last year, a 2.8% drop from 2017 and a 55.3% drop from the 1,022,000 units sold in 2006. By contrast, PPM&acirc;Äôs recent estimates show a record 458,000 UTVs sold in the United States in 2018, up 5.9% from 2017 and a 95.3% gain from 2006. Harley-Davidson currently dominates motorcycle market share, while Polaris tops UTV sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background:rgba(0,0,0,0.1);padding:0px 10px 1px 10px;border-radius:5px;border:1px solid #000;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://visua.com/sports-sponsorship-trends/&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sports Sponsorship Trends for 2019 - visua-logo&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;cite&gt;visua.com&lt;span class=&quot;eipWBe&quot;&gt; &acirc;Ä&ordm; sports-sponsorshi...&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;color:rgba(0,0,0,0.6);&quot;&gt;The &lt;em&gt;world&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Sports&lt;/em&gt; Sponsorship has seen much growth in the last couple of years. So what &lt;em&gt;trends&lt;/em&gt; should we expect to see in 2019? Esports sponsorship has&lt;wbr&gt; ...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&acirc;ÄúWhile Harley continues to lead the pack with nearly 30% market share in motorcycles, it appears that brands such as Kawasaki, Honda and KTM are experiencing growing sales in an otherwise subdued market atmosphere,&acirc;Äù Boeder said. &acirc;ÄúOn-road, we&acirc;Äôre seeing the cruiser segment experiencing declining sales; growth in sport bikes benefiting from small-displacement models from Honda, Kawasaki, KTM and Suzuki; and touring bikes are also experiencing declining sales, although with BMW, Honda, Moto Guzzi and Suzuki bucking the trend. Also, motorcycles we deem as standards are seeing increased interest from consumers, with Yamaha, Kawasaki and Triumph leading the way. Boeder cited several factors contributing to the growing popularity of dual-sport models among both novice and experienced consumers. First, they&acirc;Äôre adept on both mountain trails and roads. Plus, they combine a relatively low purchase price, a standard operating platform and utility. &acirc;ÄúWhile dual-sports still represent only 10% of the total two-wheeler market, it is interesting to note the increasing number of models being offered by OEMs,&acirc;Äù Boeder added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is notably true of side-by-sides. Almost 20 years ago, the vehicles were touted for industrial and commercial uses, such as construction, farming and ranching, and turf maintenance. However, the &acirc;Äô04 introduction of the Yamaha Rhino broadened the class&acirc;Äôs appeal to outdoorsmen and off-roaders. Three years later, Polaris jumped in with the RZR, and the race was on. Boeder said the UTV&acirc;Äôs instant popularity is no surprise. &acirc;ÄúThey&acirc;Äôre easy to operate, useful in multiple terrains for work or play and-like boating-you can bring multiple people along to enjoy the ride,&acirc;Äù he said. Nate Martinez, performance coordinator for Team Alba Racing, a manufacturer of UTV performance parts based in San Diego, California, said that side-by-sides have also brought the thrill of the power-sports category to a broader audience. &acirc;ÄúATVs or dirt bikes had a lot of restrictions on where you could use them compared to what you can do with a side-by-side,&acirc;Äù he noted. &acirc;ÄúSome of those vehicles are used very hard, in different markets and in different ways,&acirc;Äù confirmed Jason Hanson, sales manager for Boss Audio, a maker of a full line of powersports sound systems. &acirc;ÄúIn a lot of areas, they&acirc;Äôre used as hunting vehicles. Glamis or Ocotillo Wells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you go to Texas, they&acirc;Äôre going through mud bogs, same as in Florida. In fact, Hannon believes that the motorcycle market remains stable, thanks in part to side-by-sides. &acirc;ÄúThey&acirc;Äôre sort of tied together,&acirc;Äù he said. ATV and quad markets are shrinking dramatically. That&acirc;Äôs just because it used to be that you&acirc;Äôd need four quads for a family of four to go out to ride, and you&acirc;Äôd need to trailer them and have helmets and all that riding gear to go along with them. Now you can have one four-passenger side-by-side, and that takes care of your entire family. That&acirc;Äôs why the growth of the side-by-side market is skyrocketing. It&acirc;Äôs a lot more fun to do with a group. For now, the Polaris RZR rules the UTV roost, mainly due to the vehicle&acirc;Äôs production volumes, according to Team Alba&acirc;Äôs Martinez. &acirc;ÄúAre there vehicles that compete with it? Yes, 100%,&acirc;Äù he said. &acirc;ÄúCan-Am has come to market with an awesome vehicle that has its pluses but obviously has its minuses. The number-one Polaris competitor is Can-Am, and then you&acirc;Äôve got Yamaha. You also have Arctic Cat/Textron, and you have Honda, which recently released its first real side-by-side.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Early Years: Quick Basketball History In The Philippines]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Soccer maybe the world&acirc;Äôs most famous sport, but basketball&acirc;Äôs popularity in the Philippines has been a long time trend that never fades. There are numbers of reasons why Filipinos appreciate basketball. Primarily because Filipinos like sports that is dynamic, tactical, and entertaining. Second, anyone can play the game with makeshift courts on sandlots and neighborhood nook. As a sports enthusiast, yearly improvement of sports rankings for local teams in the Philippines competing from different countries is quite an achievement for every us, Filipinos. Below are the three highlighting eras of basketball history in the Philippines. This will show basketball culture in the Philippines, success, tradition, and achievements of Philippine basketball teams from leagues and tournaments. Basketball in the Philippines during the American occupation of the Philippines which was thought by the first American teachers teaching sports along with the sport baseball through the YMCA and school system. In 1954, Philippines team got bronze medal for third place and was announced as the best performance by an Asian team in the World Championship. Just like what happened in 1950, where Philippine team joined in the 1954 FIBA World Championship held at Rio de Janerio Brazil and took home a bronze medal which still stand out as the best finish by an Asian country in the World Cup. In 1960&acirc;Äôs Philippine team with Carlos Badion as the tournament&acirc;Äôs Most Valuable Player won the first FIBA Asia Championship. It led the Philippines to host the third FIBA World Championship. The country continued to play competitively in the Asian and World Championships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/QEr3HBjm88Y?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;modestbranding=1' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen title='2010 Volkswagen CC'&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was ripped now. &acirc;ÄúI just decided that a person probably shouldn&acirc;Äôt turn into a ball,&acirc;Äù he told me. We set out jogging west, toward Tiananmen Square and a loop around the Forbidden City&acirc;Äôs moat, a common jogging route in Beijing. We passed the first hotel I&acirc;Äôd ever stayed at in China, more than a decade prior, where I remember watching crowds of bicycles during rush hour. There were fewer now, replaced by mopeds and cars. It was a consequential time to be running by Tiananmen Square and the Great Hall of the People: During the annual legislative session last March, China&acirc;Äôs president, Xi Jinping, had amended the constitution to rid the presidency of term limits. Security vehicles lined the streets, but no one in the group said much about them-such sights had become commonplace in Beijing over the past few years. I couldn&acirc;Äôt help but ponder the contradictions between the rapid growth of running-a sport that, at its essence, epitomized individualism-and the government&acirc;Äôs more recent authoritarian turns. But China was always full of such contradictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its society-especially the young, urban contingent-was often moving one way, with a government moving another, and I sometimes wondered whether such contradictions would ever fully resolve themselves. As we passed the eastern side of Zhongnanhai, the main residence for China&acirc;Äôs central leadership, my running partner urged me to keep up the pace. &acirc;ÄúWe can&acirc;Äôt stop here,&acirc;Äù he said, nodding toward the police officers. We ignored them and kept going, as many tend to in China. The contradiction, I was reminded, wasn&acirc;Äôt worth obsessing over, the way it so often was in Western media. And I thought of the real changes that seemed to outweigh the presence of an old guard: Qi Min had made a new life for himself without state support, Youji was growing its numbers, Zuiku was registering more racers, and urbanites continued to run themselves out of the shape of a ball. Running had become so big, so contagious, that no matter the maneuverings inside Zhongnanhai, or how many police lined the streets outside, China would run on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must already know sports surfing. The most visited surf destination is the island of Bali. There are many beaches with waves that are challenging and desirable. Before we discuss some of the beaches in Bali that became a favorite surfing place, we know the history of surfing. Previously in Hawaii, there was an ancient tradition called &quot;he'e nalu which means the shift of a wave.&quot; According to the ancient Hawaiian culture that the sea that has the waves is a mirror of an emotion, surfing is used to test the ability to risk wealth, white people came to Hawaii, the culture changed when Captain Cook in the late 18th century came. Since then surfing has become a sport with no traditional, cultural and spiritual elements. In 1900 'Waikiki Beach Boys' (a group of young guardians') made this sport even more famous. The first surfer George Freeth took advantage of surfing as a railway promotion, then in 1915 Duke Kahanamoku (an important person in the history of surfing) introduced surfing to Australia. Design papa skating increasingly famous in the 1920s that make this sport much-loved and become the beginning of the competence of surfing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background:rgba(0,0,0,0.1);padding:0px 10px 1px 10px;border-radius:5px;border:1px solid #000;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2020/05/12/the-post-covid-world-of-sports.html&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The post-COVID world of sports - Lifestyle - The Jakarta Post&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;cite&gt;www.thejakartapost.com&lt;span class=&quot;eipWBe&quot;&gt; &acirc;Ä&ordm; life&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;color:rgba(0,0,0,0.6);&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;f&quot;&gt;12 Mei 2020 -&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martinez also attested to that. &acirc;Äù he said. &acirc;ÄúECU tuning is also a giant thing nowadays. For the most part, every single manufacturer has left something on the table inside of the tune. Add to that the small protective parts that we&acirc;Äôve learned have prevented more expensive failures over time on particular vehicles. Along the latter lines, items such as belts, clutch guards and increased cooling system capacity and protection often top the list among Team Alba&acirc;Äôs customers, many of whom are Yamaha enthusiasts. &acirc;ÄúI would say that the largest market as far as aftermarket performance parts is definitely the Yamaha,&acirc;Äù he said. Given the dark terrain that UTVs often inhabit, it&acirc;Äôs little surprise that aftermarket lighting companies are seeing sales to the segment steadily climb. &acirc;ÄúHands down, the UTV market is the largest powersports lighting consumer for us,&acirc;Äù said Vision X Lighting Marketing Director Danny Adair. &acirc;ÄúIn OE form, most of the machines have lackluster headlights and no auxiliary lights, thus creating the need for additional lighting or brighter OE-replacement options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a solution provider, we like to think that they&acirc;Äôre looking for the best performance; however, we&acirc;Äôve learned that looks and style are still one of the top priorities. &acirc;ÄúWe&acirc;Äôve found that the LED pods such as our 3.7-in. Mini Cannons and XPL single-row light bars are the most popular forward-lighting additions. That size allows them to be mounted on the A-pillars or front bumpers, providing a tremendous amount of light without drawing large amounts of power. UTVs typically don&acirc;Äôt have an alternator, so power draw is a conscious decision when choosing how many lights and what lights to run. Our next popular product category is vehicle-specific items such as Polaris RZR headlight kits or bolt-in lightbar kits. Yet lighting companies such as Vision X haven&acirc;Äôt forgotten that motorcycles still comprise the core of the powersports market despite present UTV trends. &acirc;ÄúThe dual-sport/adventure-bike market is still growing,&acirc;Äù Adair explained. &acirc;ÄúWe&acirc;Äôve seen an uptick in demand for complete auxiliary lighting systems, which we manufacture for some partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the rising UTV tide has grabbed the attention of larger manufacturers in the wheel and tire segment. They have rushed in to compete with the smaller niche companies that had gotten used to catering to the UTV community almost exclusively. &acirc;ÄúYou start getting these cars that weigh 2,000 lbs. 30- to 32-in.-tall tire from the factory with 15-in. wheels, and you&acirc;Äôre right in the automotive segment,&acirc;Äù said Tim Orchard, owner and founder of OMF Performance Products, a maker of one-off/custom wheels for UTVs. &acirc;ÄúWhen the side-by-sides got up into the wheel and tire sizes they&acirc;Äôre doing now, and with the quantities of the vehicles that are out there, the big wheel manufacturers that bring stuff in from China and all over the world have gotten into it because they saw the potential. Orchard has found a solution by positioning his products for consumers seeking well-crafted wheels with exclusive styling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaming will continue to redefine how recreation time is spent. New thinking, partnerships and a pioneering mentality are going to take eSports entertainment to greater levels. The wave of innovative formats driven by sports rights holders is already shining a spotlight on what is possible - the inaugural ePremier League and the third season of F1&acirc;Äôs eSports series in June are two examples. But this is only scratching the surface. To raise the bar further there needs to be fresh sets of conversations about how to create exclusive entertainment-based content rights that complement professional events while adding millions of new fans to the games. New ideas, new formats, new heroes. Some brands want to dip their toes, try a small-scale event and evaluate it through a traditional &acirc;Äòmedia buy&acirc;Äô lens. Others believe in what is happening and are investing ahead of the curve for the long term. The winners and losers in this industry will be those who have their fingers on the pulse of the consumer and those that don&acirc;Äôt. And while in marketing that is nothing new, the challenge is not to approach this industry by looking back at what has happened in the past, or through the rearview mirror. Foresight is needed. In the gaming world the rules are still being written and models created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) - HBO Max has temporarily removed &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; from its streaming library in order to add historical context to the 1939 film long criticized for romanticizing slavery and the Civil War-era South. Protests in the wake of George Floyd's death have forced entertainment companies to grapple with the appropriateness of both current and past productions. On Tuesday, the Paramount Network dropped the long-running reality series &quot;Cops&quot; after 33 seasons. The BBC also removed episodes of &quot;Little Britain,&quot; a comedy series that featured a character in blackface, from its streaming service. In a statement, the AT&amp;T-owned WarnerMedia, which owns HBO Max, called &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; &quot;a product of its time&quot; that depicts racial prejudices. HBO Max spokesman in a statement. For more than 70 years, the Confederate flag was a familiar sight at NASCAR races. Through the civil rights era right on through the season opener at Daytona in February, the flag dotted infield campsites and was waved in grandstands by fans young and old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the nation - and at last, NASCAR -- comes to grips with race relations in the wake of the death of George Floyd, it was time: The flag is no longer welcome in the stock car series. NASCAR banned the flag at its races and all its venues Wednesday, a dramatic if overdue step by a series steeped in Southern tradition and proud of its good ol' boy roots. It must now hope to convince some of its most ardent fans that it is truly time to leave the flag at home, leave those T-shirts in the drawer, scrape off the bumper stickers and hit the track without a trace of the longtime symbol to many of racism and slavery. Policing the policy may prove challenging and NASCAR did not offer details. The issue was pushed to the fore this week by Bubba Wallace, NASCAR&Acirc;&acute;s lone black driver and an Alabama native who called for the banishment of the Confederate flag and said there was &quot;no place&quot; for them in the sport. BlackLivesMatter paint scheme. Wallace, wearing an American flag mask, clapped his hands when asked about the decision before the start of the race.&lt;/p&gt;

It is also a league of professional sports. Around the world; NHL has the highest standard, which is also a professional hockey game.

In 1917, the league was established in Montreal Quebec. There were five teams at first, after a series of extension, it has thirty teams now. There were twenty-four teams in the United States and six teams in Canada. After the players' general strike during the season of 2004 to 2005, the league had a regular season from 2005 to 2006 and a playoff of Stanley Cup in two thousand and six.&lt;/p&gt;

The amount of European and American players put on an upward trend when NHL broadened its high levels to the United States positively. Nevertheless; during the season from two thousand five to two thousand six, half of the players were the natives of Canada. In 1908, the International Ice Hockey Federation was founded in Paris. Headquarter located in Zurich, Switzerland. The United Kingdom was the winner in the first hockey tournament in 1910. NHL was founded in Montreal of Canada seven years later. At the beginning of the establishment, there were five teams. In recent years, NHL has become a successful league of profession and commercial all over the world. The playing method of six-a-play was first put forward by the National Hockey Association of Canada in 1912. And the influence of NHL is getting more and more important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be similar to the basketball of the world; the United States' Stanley Cup of Hockey League has said to be a legendary honor. For millions of hockey fans, this sport has the same meaning to other sports, such as skating, baseball bats, hockey, body collision, fighting and saving the goal line. Canada's sports foundation is in its east coast. Most historians believe that ice hockey originated in Windsor area in 1870. In the 19th century, this sport develops to Canada's western part quickly. And soon spread from the Atlantic Ocean to Europe and became popular in the United States. With the development of the North American continent, the number of hockey league games appears a rapid growth. In 1917, the National Hockey Association was restructured and eventually produced the National Hockey League. There were only five teams in NHL, which were Quebec Bulldogs, Montreal Wanderers and Montreal Canadians, Ottawa Senators and Toronto sports teams. In the early time, NHL was quite unstable. For instance, in the first competition, the Quebec Bulldogs team refused to take part in. Because of the damaged area by fire, Montreal team withdrew from the league.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In China, there was an infamous story of an athlete with Olympic dreams who had been found begging on the street following retirement. And most runners like Qi Min and Shen Jiasheng were still in tenuous financial situations, which they often dealt with through dark humor. When I asked Qi Min about the video, he smirked. &acirc;ÄúFun, right?&acirc;Äù he said. Wei Jun, a former bureaucrat who left the sports ministry in 2014 to found his own race outfit, was more cautious in declaring sponsored athletes who&acirc;Äôd escaped the state system as having &acirc;Äúmade it.&acirc;Äù The pressure to over-compete for prize money and attention, he told me, was an incentive many newly commercial runners in China struggled to handle. Qi Min, Yao Miao, and Shen Jiasheng trained without coaches, who tended to work only at the training academies, and that could mean a higher chance of getting injured. On WeChat, when I asked Qi Min why he didn&acirc;Äôt hire a coach, he gave a simpler, half-joking answer, which he sent to me with two frowning emojis.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;title&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Brass Mangalsutra Everlasting Bond Of Marriage - Jewelry]]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;content:encoded&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Our rich Indian culture is well known across the globe. Indian customs and traditions have been accepted widely with great respect. We the Indians are said to be deep rooted to our cultural and moral values which make us stand uniquely among the other cultures in the world. There are certain customs and traditions which are to be followed by Hindus. Like birth ceremony, marriage ceremony, naamkaran ceremony and grah pravesh ceremony, there are certain rituals that are to be followed by hindus. In Hindu religion marriage is considered as social institution, it is a sacred ceremony where two persons commit to spend their rest of the lives together. It is a social occasion where the couple follows the divine rituals to enter a new phase of their life called marriage. Wedding is a social ceremony where the newly wed couple seeks the blessings of their near and dear ones to begin a new chapter of life happily. According to Hindu religion a bride or a girl going to get married has to adorn certain jewelry and has to follow special customs which clearly indicate her marital status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/jb4eluvTO_o?showinfo=0&amp;iv_load_policy=3&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen title=&quot;THE FASTEST ELECTRIC CARS In The&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many cultures of the world like a couple wears wedding ring after marriage, in Hindu religion the bride has to wear Mangalsutra, nose rings, maangtika, bangles and toe rings, to show her marital status she has sport a red bindi or kumkum on her forehead.

Children occasionally joined the runners, and villagers lined the streets at the larger checkpoints. In Yongle, one of the bigger villages along the route, locals stopped traffic and watched closely, many of the women hoisting infants on their backs as the runners sped by. &acirc;ÄúMy first reaction to the race was that I didn&acirc;Äôt believe it,&acirc;Äù a local from Yongle named Ren Changchen told me. &acirc;ÄúIt&acirc;Äôs incomprehensible, that kind of distance! After a few hours of touring the checkpoints, we arrived at the finish, in Heshun, a preserved old town of stone alleyways just outside Tengchong. The top runners of the 55K began to finish, with Li Yungui taking first place, and Jason Schlarb finishing some 20 minutes later. Budha finished fifth overall, for a dominant win in the women&acirc;Äôs field. Later that afternoon, Shen Jiasheng cruised past the finish line, taking first place in the 125K, which began the same morning. Thunderous applause and iPhone snaps from the crowd greeted him, while the gregarious emcee Li Zhaohui nearly gave himself a heart attack showering praise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shen Jiasheng waited patiently for the second-place finisher, the young Japanese runner Ruy Ueda, who the crowd was affectionately calling &acirc;Äúyoung fresh meat,&acirc;Äù and embraced him upon his finish. A few hours later, Qi Min took off at 8 pm for the 100-miler, alongside Krissy Moehl, Mike Wardian, and Gediminas Grinius, to pumping EDM and the screams of the tireless Li Zhaohui, now dressed in a costume depicting an ancient Daoist monk. Bull and Toropov sped off to track Samantha Chan, a promising young runner from Hong Kong, and I turned in for the night. Just before dozing off, I checked Qi Min&acirc;Äôs progress. I awoke the next day to news that Qi Min had dropped out at around 82 kilometers, just over halfway through the race. Toropov thought he probably had forgotten to drink enough water, a mistake he&acirc;Äôd observed Qi Min make before, but with fewer consequences during 100K races.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&acirc;ÄúOn my first hundred-miler I had to pull out of the race, overestimated myself and underestimated 100 miles&acirc;Ä&brvbar; Later that afternoon, I visited Qi Min and Shen Jiasheng in their hotel. They were half asleep in their beds, and Qi Min gave a polite hello. His first experience running all night had left him unexpectedly dizzy, and he&acirc;Äôd peed blood before he&acirc;Äôd decided to withdraw. He was disappointed, yet still in good spirits. I couldn&acirc;Äôt help but think back to Wei Jun&acirc;Äôs warnings about the temptations of over-racing and training. Qi Min and Shen Jiasheng told me to keep in touch. Months later, Qi Min bounced back, crushing the pace and finishing second at the prestigious Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc&acirc;Äôs 101K in Chamonix. Back at the Gaoligong race finish, Gediminas cruised in for the 160K win, and Krissy Moehl came in a few hours later to take the women&acirc;Äôs title. The next day, the podium finishers received medals, gave interviews, and made molds of their feet in yellow putty to take home.&lt;/p&gt;
